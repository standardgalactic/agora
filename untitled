Hotstring Helper
Andreas Borutta suggested the following script, which might be useful if you are a heavy user of hotstrings. By pressing Win+H (or another hotkey of your choice), the currently selected text can be turned into a hotstring. For example, if you have "by the way" selected in a word processor, pressing Win+H will prompt you for its abbreviation (e.g. btw) and then add the new hotstring to the script. It will then reload the script to activate the hotstring.

I wonder why I would do it this way. For one, I don't really have byobu in git bash. And my vim doesn't work well in ubuntu wsl so I usually ssh into the mac to use vim, or use gvim in windows.
