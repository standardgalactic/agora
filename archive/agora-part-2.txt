CAN WE SURVIVE ON OUR 
OWN?
HUNTER-GATHERERS WERE 
JACKS ANDJills of all trades, 
the original Renaissance men 
and women. However, their 
knowledge must have been a 
mile wide and an inch deep. 
They really were jacks of 
all trades but masters of 
none. I suspect there was no 
one alive in the Paleolithic 
era who could make relish 
anywhere near as well as 

one of today's relish 
makers. But if someone from 
the last ice age along with a 
modern relish maker were 
dropped on a desert island 
for some reality TV show, I 
know who I would put my five 
bucks on.
Our specialization has served 
us well. Before cities, the 
human population was 
thought to be well under a 
million. Even when Uruk was 
at its height, world 

population was probably only 
around eight million. The 
story of how we got from 
eight million to eight billion 
is the story of how 
specialization empowered us 
to become a thousand times 
more than we formerly 
were.
To achieve the incredible 
increases in productivity 
that specialization makes 
possible, each part of the 
superorganism has to focus 

on a narrow range of things 
that it does well, to the 
neglect of much else. As 
society grows more complex, 
each of us knows how to do a 
smaller and smaller 
percentage of everything 
needed to maintain it. Maybe 
in a band of hunter-
gatherers, any individual 
could do 80 percent of 
everything needed to 
survive, but each of us, as 
members of a complex 

society, may only be able to 
do 1 percent.
So, have humans done what 
all other creatures who 
form superorganisms do? 
That is, become so specialized 
that we can't survive alone 
anymore? By "alone" I mean 
the proverbial "dropped on a 
desert island" scenario 
where we have nothing but 
the clothes on our backs and 
the knowledge in our heads.

Given this setup—modeled 
after a single bee being 
separated from the hive—I 
think we would all fare 
poorly. This is for two 
reasons, both relating to 
specialization. The first is 
what you normally think of 
with the division of labor: 
We lack the broad range of 
skills that we would need to 
survive. The second reason 
is that in addition to the 
"regular" division of labor, 
there is a cognitive version 

of it as well. It turns out 
for us, thinking is now a 
communal activity, and so we 
can no longer do that on our 
own either.
We are going to look at these 
one at a time. But before we 
dive in, I want to point out 
that while it would be easy 
to find this chapter 
discouraging, I offer a 
different interpretation. 
The overarching idea to keep 
in mind is not how 

incompetent we are. We 
obviously aren't. The big 
idea here is coevolution, 
which we covered earlier. 
That's where the bee and 
the flower evolve with each 
other and form a symbiosis of 
sorts. Individually, we 
haven't regressed; we've 
simply coevolved to live in 
community together. If we 
are removed from that 
community, there is no shame 
in the fact most of us 
couldn't survive, any more 

than a bee should be 
ashamed it cannot survive 
without flowers.
So how many of us could 
muddle through by 
ourselves? Obviously, we 
aren't trafficking in 
absolutes here. The portion 
of people who could survive 
on their own is neither zero 
percent nor a hundred. 
Humans are so amazing, so 
resourceful, and so 
intelligent that a few are 

bound to make it through. 
This wouldn't disprove 
Agora as a superorganism 
because as we will see, most 
of us wouldn't make it, and 
the few that would 
wouldn't have an easy time 
of it.
Let's start with a 
hypothetical one hundred 
random Americans, a group I 
can find good data on. Let's 
look at some numbers that 
might bear on their ability to 

survive the physical rigors 
of living alone. We aren't 
even talking about lack of 
knowledge yet, just whether 
people could physically 
survive separated from 
civilization. According to the 
CDC's numbers, eleven of 
our one hundred have 
severe mobility issues, five 
are blind or nearly so, and 
three have difficulty with 
self-care. All of those 
folks would have added 
challenges right out of the 

gate, but they still might 
make it. There are people 
who need life-sustaining 
medicines: the three that 
need insulin, the two on 
post-heart-attack 
medication, the one on post-
stroke blood thinners; and 
none of those would be 
available any more. In 
addition, about a quarter of 
Americans take three or 
more prescription drugs a 
month, but we don't know 
how many of those they 

couldn't live without. 
Finally, some portion of our 
hundred are at extreme 
ends of the age spectrum. 
Most centenarians and 
toddlers would be hard-
pressed to survive alone.
What is the net of all of 
this? It's hard to say 
exactly, but just at a gut 
level, let's say that half 
of Americans wouldn't make 
it very long based on their 
age and health alone. That 

actually speaks incredibly 
well of us as a society. One 
of the best things about 
modernity is how we are able 
to help people at the margins 
of health and wellness not 
just live but also participate 
in the daily life of our 
culture.
How would the other fifty 
fare? Let's assume they are 
scattered randomly around 
the world, and where they 
landed would have a great 

deal of influence on 
whether they survived. If in 
a desert, well, game over 
before it starts. Same with 
the far north and south. 
While tropical islands have 
their romantic appeal, life 
there wouldn't consist of 
long walks on the beach at 
sunset sipping mai tais. So 
let's remove half of our 
fifty for ending up in less-
than-hospitable locales.

The twenty-five still left 
will not have it easy. After 
all, they don't get to take a 
pickup truck of equipment 
with them. That's a piece of 
Agora. As we've discussed, 
that's billions of person-
years of innovation and the 
combined knowledge of 
millions of people. That's 
not living apart from Agora; 
that's not surviving on your 
own. We might as well let 
them take a camper and have 
groceries delivered twice a 

week. We're talking about a 
scenario where people are 
separated from all of that. 
This is no Gilligan's Island, 
where they each happen to 
have brought a wide variety 
of handy items, which is odd 
for a three-hour tour. A 
three-hour tour.
So, of the twenty-five who 
have made it over our first 
two hurdles, how many would 
know the following things 
that would be necessary for 

survival? Let's use you, the 
reader, as a proxy. Do you 
know all of this:
•The berry rule: 90 
percent of yellow and white 
berries are poisonous, 50 
percent of red ones are, and 
only 10 percent of black and 
blue ones are. And are you 
familiar with the technique 
to determine whether a 
particular berry is poisonous? 
Rub some on your arm first, 
wait a few hours, then a tiny 
piece on the inside of your 

cheek, and . . . well, it goes 
on, but even if you know it, 
it isn't foolproof.
•Don't eat if you don't 
have water. Especially 
don't eat protein without 
water, or you'll succumb to 
protein poisoning.
•Ahh, water. You need a 
gallon a day. If you found 
yourself in a tropical 
paradise, would you drink 
coconut milk? Well, you may 

have just signed your death 
warrant. It's a laxative, and 
if that's all you drink, you 
will quickly die of 
dehydration. Then there is 
water with parasites in it. 
Could you tell likely safe 
water from unsafe, assuming 
you had access to any at all? 
And don't forget to boil 
your water. Oh, wait . . . you 
don't have anything to boil 
it in.

•The correct way to prepare 
and eat cattails? Or whether 
you should eat plants with 
milky sap? Or waxy leaves? 
How about wild onions? In 
theory they are fine, but 
there are toxic plants 
almost identical to them. Can 
you tell them apart?
•Fishing probably isn't a 
good use of your time since 
you would probably spend 
more calories trying to catch 
a fish than you would get by 
eating it. And would you eat 

it raw? There are those 
parasites again. Even sushi 
must be frozen for fifteen 
hours at -31 degrees 
Fahrenheit to kill them. 
Serving raw fish that hasn't 
been frozen is illegal in the 
United States and 
elsewhere.
•Then realize this will all 
likely change with the 
seasons. How will you 
overwinter? Or endure a 
blistering summer?

Scurvy and malnutrition are 
just waiting for you to slip 
up, along with starvation. 
Maybe you've heard the 
story of Chris McCandless, a 
twenty-four-year-old who 
decided to be a nomad and 
live off the land in the 
Alaskan bush. He set out in 
April 1992 and happened 
upon an abandoned bus, which 
he decided to live in. He is 
suspected of raiding some 
empty cabins for supplies, 
but, in spite of this, he died 

of starvation by August, 
weighing just sixty-seven 
pounds. After just four 
months. Summer months at 
that.
Then, you better hope you 
don't cut yourself, because 
if the cut becomes infected, 
that's almost a death 
sentence without antibiotics. 
Don't get appendicitis, or 
gallstones, or kidney stones, 
or anything that would 
require surgery. Or a 

toothache that needs a root 
canal. Let's hope you aren't 
near predators or venomous 
animals. Cross your fingers 
that there's never bad 
weather.
We haven't even touched on 
building a shelter or 
maintaining your mental 
health. Maybe you would 
have a volleyball named 
Wilson to talk to, but that 
would be a best-case 
scenario. Suicide would always 

be lurking in your mind as an 
option, but there isn't even 
a quick and easy way to do 
that, let alone a painless 
one.
A 2021 survey of two 
thousand Americans revealed 
that only one in seven are 
very confident they could 
start a fire with flint and 
steel, which you probably 
won't have. Only one in 
seven are confident they 
can identify edible food. 

Only a third could spot 
poison ivy in a photo. 
Collectively, on average, 
they thought they could 
survive sixteen days alone in 
the wilderness. I admire 
their optimism.
My guess is that few of us 
could actually last in the 
wilderness. Even most 
survival experts would 
perish without appropriate 
gear. If we bent the rules 
and let everyone have a 

backpack full of Agora-
created gadgets and books, I 
think they only postpone the 
inevitable.
Certainly, we hear amazing 
stories of survival against 
the odds. But that's 
because they are so rare. 
And the survivors always 
have some amount of 
equipment. Earlier, we 
looked at the Grafton 
castaways—you know, those 
guys who were stranded on 

an island and started brewing 
beer. But keep in mind that 
that was 1864, a time with 
less specialization, and they 
were all lifelong sailors who 
had lived in incredibly harsh 
conditions before. It wasn't 
even the first shipwreck 
for all of them. Finally, 
remember that we are 
talking about how many 
people can simply survive. We 
haven't even touched on 
thrive.

Sure, Bear Grylls might be 
able to eschew society and 
make it on his own in the 
Yukon with nothing but a 
paper clip, a slingshot, and a 
piece of beef jerky, but 
he's basically an honorary 
hunter-gatherer. The rest 
of us mere mortals have 
thrown in our lot with 
society and have specialized 
to such a degree that we can 
no longer function on our 
own.

But that's just the first of 
two reasons we can't 
survive on our own. Let's 
say a few people make it past 
all of these hurdles. What 
next? You might be thinking, 
"Humans are a pretty smart 
bunch of folks. Sure, the 
few weeks would be really 
rough, but the setup of the 
problem is that they get to 
keep everything they know, 
and humans know a great 
deal. They'd be brewing 
beer in no time."

I wish that were all true, 
but I don't think it is. 
There's the second reason, 
the cognitive division of 
labor, which would doom even 
the intrepid few who've 
made it this far. Let's look 
at that.
Our "thing" as a species is 
that we are the smart ones. 
Our brains are often hailed 
as the most exquisite, 
complex things in the known 
universe, but that's a bit 

self-serving since they are 
the ones doing the hailing. 
But they do have a point. 
Our position as the most 
powerful creature on the 
planet is based not on our 
bodies but on our minds.
Yes, we are smart, 
undoubtedly, but that 
doesn't mean we have 
"general purpose" 
intellects. Instead, we have 
highly specialized ones. It 
isn't that we're dim bulbs, 

rather that there is a 
cognitive version of the 
division of labor. Not only 
can we dojust a narrow range 
of tasks, but we only knowa 
narrow range of things as 
well. I know it doesn't feel 
like that, but each of us 
knows less than we think we 
do.
I recall an old Night 
Courtepisode where the 
bailiff is struck with 
appendicitis and is taken to 

the ER. The only doctor on 
hand is a podiatrist, who 
bristles at the suggestion 
that he is less qualified 
than a regular doctor. When 
the bailiff lets out another 
agonizing scream, the 
podiatrist suggests that "it 
might be his shoes." That's 
each of us.
Polls that show how ignorant 
we are make good headlines. 
You've probably seen them, 
too, how only half of 

Americans know the sun is a 
star, or how more people can 
name the Three Stooges than 
three justices on the 
Supreme Court. But that is 
all just clickbait, really, and 
it's irrelevant. What does 
matter are all the things we 
think we know that we 
actually don't.
In 2002, Leonid Rozenblit and 
Frank Keil, both of Yale, 
published a paper called 
"The Misunderstood Limits 

of Folk Science: An Illusion 
of Explanatory Depth." In 
it, the authors' opening 
sentence sums up their 
findings well: "People feel 
they understand complex 
phenomena with far greater 
precision, coherence, and 
depth than they really do." 
It is a pretty humbling paper 
to read. Spread throughout 
its forty-two pages are the 
results of a range of 
experiments that show that 
while people think they 

understand a certain object, 
such as a speedometer, a 
zipper, a piano key, a flush 
toilet, a cylinder lock, a 
helicopter, a quartz watch, 
and a sewing machine, when 
asked to explain it in detail, 
the subjects faltered.
Four years later, Rebecca 
Lawson at the University of 
Liverpool added to these 
findings by showing that even 
people's understanding of 
objects they are familiar 

with is similarly impaired. She 
asked subjects to self-score 
their knowledge of bicycles, 
and then she gave them a 
bare-bones drawing of a 
bicycle frame and asked them 
to correctly place the chain, 
the pedals, and any parts of 
the frame that were missing. 
Forty percent made errors, 
more or less, across all the 
levels of reported bicycle 
knowledge, even the self-
described experts.

But it isn't just technology 
that we think we understand 
more than we do. We also 
overestimate our knowledge 
of natural phenomena such 
as rainbows and tides, as well 
as economics, politics, history, 
and, well, pretty much 
every other sphere of life.
What's going on here? Are 
we that deluded about what 
we know? Philip Fernbach, a 
professor at the Leeds 
School of Business at the 

University of Colorado and 
coauthor of the book The 
Knowledge Illusion, suggested 
in his TEDx talk, "As 
individuals, we do not know 
enough to justify almost 
anything we believe . . . 
[L]et's think about a couple 
of really obvious facts. We 
all believe that the earth 
revolves around the sun . . . 
But on what basis? Can you 
explain the astronomical 
observations that support 
that belief? I know I can't."

He uses the example of 
flat-earthers and compares 
them to the rest of us, 
saying that "they're not all 
that different than you and 
I." He suggests that when we 
meet someone who holds a 
view that we regard with 
contempt, we should realize, 
"They did not arrive at 
their position via a rational 
process of evidence 
evaluation and they don't 
understand the issue in 
depth. But neither do you!"

This is a biting truth, to be 
sure. But upon reflection, 
we shouldn't be 
embarrassed by it. It is just 
another form of the division 
of labor—a cognitive form. 
Just as, as mentioned earlier, 
it is a gift to be able to use 
technology without 
understanding it, it is also a 
gift that we can benefit 
from the knowledge of 
others as if it were our own.

Maybe we have all imagined 
what it would be like to 
travel back in time and amaze 
the locals with the 
astonishing things we knew 
how to do. Until, of course, 
we realized we don't know 
how to do anything. If I could 
somehow craft a laser 
pointer, I could start a 
pretty compelling religion. 
But obviously I couldn't. 
The best I could probably 
muster would be a mediocre 
flyswatter. There are a few 

things I would know that 
would be useful, like how 
you should boil water to kill 
the germs in it, but I sure 
wouldn't be making a light 
bulb or even a pencil. In 
fact, depending on what time 
period I went back to, there 
is a good chance that I would 
be more of a liability than an 
asset because I wouldn't 
know how to navigate that 
world.

But if we know so little, 
how do we survive at all, let 
alone thrive? The 
superorganism of us is able 
to "think" by using all of 
our collected knowledge. As 
Fernbach said, "Thinking is a 
social process. Rather than 
happening inside your head, 
it emerges from your 
interactions with those 
around you. People are a 
little more like bees than 
we often realize."

The challenge is that we 
don't differentiate what 
we know firsthand, which is 
precious little, from what 
we know second- or 
thirdhand. I've been to 
Hawaii so I know it exists, but 
I haven't been to Alaska, 
yet I am equally confident 
that it, too, exists. We all 
believe, at some level, in 
the transitive power of 
knowledge. One hypothetical 
example: Jill, who is an 
intern at NASA, tells you 

something about the moon you 
didn't know, and so you are 
inclined to regard it as a 
fact and confidently pass it 
along as such. But of course, 
Jill hasn't been to the moon, 
so she only got that 
knowledge from someone else 
that she trusts. Perhaps it 
eventually tracks back to 
something Buzz Aldrin was 
once overheard saying at a 
Christmas party, but maybe 
not. It turns out that for 
everyone who truly knows 

something, there are others, 
perhaps thousands, whose 
only basis for belief in it is 
that someone they trusted 
said it, which they in turn 
heard from someone they 
trusted, who got it on good 
authority from someone they 
trusted.
We shouldn't feel bad about 
it, for imagine if it were 
otherwise, that you refused 
to learn from anyone else 
and had no access to the 

knowledge of others. Our 
communal thinking is a 
feature, not a bug. Turning 
to Fernbach one last time, 
he says, "On our own, none 
of us knows all that much, 
we don't have to. We each 
have our own little slice of 
expertise, and our minds are 
built to collaborate and to 
share knowledge, which 
allows us to pursue 
incredibly complex goals 
when none of us has anything 

approaching the knowledge to 
understand it all."
Are there other species 
that are social thinkers? 
Steven Sloman, a professor 
at Brown University and 
Fernbach's coauthor of The 
Knowledge Illusion, weighs in 
on this, stating in an 
interview that "some 
cognitive anthropologists 
have made a strong argument 
that human beings are the 
only animals—indeed, the 
only cognitive systems—

capable of this kind of 
collaboration." He adds that 
when a parent and child are 
doing something together, 
like building a sand castle, 
"They are literally sharing 
thoughts: they are pursuing 
a common end result and 
doing so with knowledge that 
they hold in common . . . If 
one runs into a problem, the 
other might help. This 
requires that they 
understand that they share 
a goal."

As social thinkers, we are all 
part of the cognitive division 
of labor. Society can't work 
any other way. This has 
proven enormously beneficial 
to society—certainly as much 
as the occupational division 
of labor—but it has a few 
downsides, mainly around how 
hard it is to dislodge 
erroneous beliefs. No one 
wants to find out that the 
facts they have built their 
life around are false. Cue 
the flat-earthers. Even if 

you don't know a flat-
earther, you probably have 
had the experience of 
discovering—perhaps during a 
presidential election year—
that many of your friends 
and relatives are, in fact, 
idiots, and you may even 
struggle to understand why 
otherwise good and 
intelligent people could 
bring themselves to support 
thatcandidate.

We don't quite do all 
cognitive work communally. 
John Steinbeck wrote, "Our 
species is the only creative 
species, and it has only one 
creative instrument, the 
individual mind and spirit of 
a man. Nothing was ever 
created by two men. There 
are no good collaborations, 
whether in music, in art, in 
poetry, in mathematics, in 
philosophy." Steinbeck 
overstates this assertion to 
the point of absurdity. Not 

only are complex creative 
efforts, such as movies, 
true ensemble works, but I 
can think of dozens of 
creatives that are only 
known by their associations 
with others: Rodgers & 
Hammerstein, Ethan & Joel 
Coen, Gilbert & Sullivan, 
Laurel & Hardy, Penn & 
Teller, to name just a few. 
(A piece of trivia: In movie 
credits and elsewhere, the 
use of an ampersand to 
connect two names denotes a 

collaboration, while an 
"and" means they didn't 
work together, such as when 
one scriptwriter is fired and 
replaced with another, but 
they both still had a hand in 
the final work.) But I leave 
this quote in because there 
is more than a germ of truth 
in what he is saying: 
Individuals are able to be 
creative entirely on their 
own, which I think is 
wonderful, because it 
suggests to me that we 

aren't merely a committee 
of a species, and that there 
is something almost magical 
within an individual human 
mind capable of true 
creation.
That aside, virtually 
everything in the real world 
is a collaboration and 
requires group thinking. You 
can't have modern society 
without this. Forget putting 
someone on the moon; no one 
can even make a pencil 

without a lot of help. We 
each have only a bit of the 
knowledge needed to build 
our world, and we think 
communally as well. That's 
all OK, and it has served us 
well, but it does seem to 
support the proposition that 
we cannot survive alone 
anymore, that we are part of 
an integrated whole.
Man, stacking all that stuff 
together like that sure 
makes us sound like a bunch 

of sad sacks. We can do very 
little, we know very little, 
and we cannot even think on 
our own anymore. But again, 
all of that just means that 
we have evolved to function 
as a part of a superorganism, 
of Agora, not that we are 
incompetent.
A final aspect of 
superorganisms is that they 
demand uniformity and 
conformity from their parts. 
And yet humans are famously 

varied. Or are they? Let's 
have a look.CONFORMITY
ONE OF THE 
BREAKTHROUGHSin the 
Industrial Revolution was 
the idea of interchangeable 
identical parts. To us it is 
old hat, but it was a big deal 
at the time, and it helped 
make manufacturing at scale 
possible, which 
simultaneously increased the 
quality of goods while 
decreasing their price. But 
for it to work, the parts 

really had to be identical, 
and if a particular part was 
even a little different 
from the other ones—even 
if it was actually "better"—
it was counted as a defect, 
because it couldn't interact 
with the other parts 
seamlessly. So, ironically, 
better was bad, and exact 
duplication, even down to 
the flaws, was perfection.
Superorganisms are pretty 
rigid places, and conformity 

is required. If an ant starts 
acting weird, the other ants 
will kill it. It is pretty easy 
to see why. The parts of a 
superorganism are supposed 
to be interchangeable as 
well, and the organism is 
only able to function if the 
parts interact seamlessly. 
Anything out of the ordinary 
puts the whole group at risk, 
so ants ruthlessly cull any 
deviants.

Human individuality may be 
the most compelling argument 
against Agora as a living 
superorganism. We may simply 
be too varied and 
individualistic to create the 
kind of predictable order 
needed to form a 
superorganism. Or maybe not. 
Perhaps our differences are 
only cosmetic and we are 
actually largely the same. 
Let's explore this.

All human cultures allow 
for some amount of 
individuality, and most even 
celebrate it. We choose our 
clothes, our hobbies, our 
food, our religion, our jobs, 
and where we live. We listen 
to the music we like, watch 
the TV we enjoy, and 
decorate our personal spaces 
in accordance with our whims 
and fancies. We pick our 
politics, our friends, our 
passion projects, and the 
words we speak.

Society's tolerance of 
individuality has varied 
considerably over the ages. 
You don't have to wind the 
clock back too far to revisit 
a time when we had a 
narrower range of ways to 
express our unique 
personality. But today's 
modern world more and more 
at least claims to agree with 
author David Grayson, who 
wrote, "Commandment 
number one of any truly 

civilized society is this: Let 
people be different." Even 
in the most oppressive times 
in history, under the most 
restrictive autocrats we've 
ever had, there have always 
been ways, sometimes 
covertly, to express one's 
own distinctiveness.
Doesn't that mean we 
aren't the cogs in a machine 
after all? Regrettably, I 
don't think so. We encourage 
individuality, but only in 

limited, narrow ways. 
IfIdecidedtoforgotheuseofsp
acesinmywriting, my book 
sales would rightfully 
plummet. Poet e. e. cummings 
is popularly remembered for 
his rejection of capital 
letters, which is about as 
far as you are allowed to 
flout literary convention 
and still have a readership. 
Beyond that, there is little 
tolerance. Start concluding 
all your emails with ". . . in 
accordance with the 

prophecy" and see how that 
works out for you. But it 
isn't just what we say and 
write. Try walking down the 
street naked and see how 
far you get. Or if you're 
too bashful for that, just 
try skipping everywhere you 
go; the result will 
ultimately be the same. I've 
never seen a man with half a 
mustache—either the left 
or the right—which is quite 
odd in a world with hundreds 
of millions of mustaches. If 

you drive down the street in 
reverse, regardless of how 
well you do it, you will be 
stopped and given a field 
sobriety test.
But all of these are pretty 
egregious departures from 
social norms and are written 
with my tongue firmly in my 
cheek. None of us are really 
going to do those things. What 
we are about to see is that 
while certain types of 
conformity are absolutely 

necessary, society goes way 
beyond those so that even 
minor, insignificant deviations 
are not tolerated either.
Society relies on a certain 
amount of conformity. As 
such, many of our bedrock 
institutions are designed to 
promote homogeneity. Our 
public school system is a good 
example. It's designed to 
teach a range of basic 
knowledge and life skills 
that help people function in 

our complex society. That 
makes perfect sense, of 
course, and it fills an 
important role.
What's interesting about it, 
though, is how it is 
structured. Our K through 
12 system is a nineteenth-
century Prussian invention 
designed to produce factory 
workers for an 
industrializing world; so in 
pursuit of this, it was 
deliberately modeled after 

a factory: You have a 
manager—your teacher—who 
gives you work. If you have a 
question, you are supposed to 
raise your hand and ask your 
manager what to do. When 
you finish an assignment, 
your manager assesses 
whether or not you did a 
good job, and if you 
repeatedly do well, you will 
get an annual promotion. 
There is a bell that rings to 
tell you to eat lunch, to 
stop eating lunch, to change 

tasks, and finally, to go 
home. Thus, our schools 
themselves are factories, 
built to manufacture 
factory workers. There is 
nothing inherently wrong 
with this approach except 
that perhaps it is a bit 
outdated. The point is that a 
manufacturing mindset that 
views deviation as error is 
baked into the system, 
resulting in it producing 
largely homogeneous 
workers. Everyone is taught 

more or less the same things, 
and standardized tests are 
administered to measure how 
standardized the workers 
are.
Other institutions are 
designed to promote 
conformity as well. Militaries 
shave everyone's head—at 
least all men—mostly so they 
look alike. Soldiers march in 
lockstep to blend together 
as an undifferentiated 
whole, and while they break 

stride when crossing a bridge 
so as to not accidently hit its 
resonant frequency, it seems 
to be a practice only 
grudgingly tolerated. Armies 
don't generally have three 
or four different uniforms 
soldiers can choose between 
depending on their mood on a 
given day. Dress codes in 
general, be they for school 
or work, are designed to 
mute differences, and they 
seldom encourage attire that 
can be described as avant-

garde or edgy. Prohibitions 
against unnatural hair 
colors, facial tattoos, and 
body modification are 
justified because those 
variations are deemed to be 
distractions.
In addition to requiring the 
parts to be alike, 
superorganisms also require 
that the algorithms that 
govern the actions of the 
parts must be alike as well. 
Are ours? I think so. For 

instance, in most occupations, 
the goal is for all the 
workers to do their tasks 
the exact same way. Sure, 
there are exceptions. No one 
expects that two novelists 
separated from each other 
will write the same book. 
But in most situations, good 
job performance is defined as 
doing a job the way you were 
trained to, that is, just like 
everyone else. When you go 
into the bank to cash a 
check, it doesn't really 

matter which teller you get 
because they are all trained 
to do the job the same way. 
It's the same with dentists, 
waiters, lawyers, 
electricians, and, well, about 
everyone else.
Even our most complex jobs—
take brain surgeon, for 
instance—are also performed 
in carefully prescribed ways. 
Variation from the accepted 
protocol can actually be a 
criminal act, and it is 

certainly a legal liability. 
Certifications in jobs are 
granted based on one's 
ability to perform actions 
like everyone else. And 
that's the way we all want 
it. Would you want a brain 
surgeon who said, "Board 
certified? Ha! Who needs 
that? I'm self-taught." 
There's a reason that 
doctors hang diplomas in 
their offices.

Of course, in many areas of 
life there is good reason to 
require conformity. We are 
able to build skyscrapers 
only because a wide variety 
of workers with diverse 
backgrounds are able to mesh 
together and work toward a 
common goal. Even if the 
algorithms of two workers 
are a bit different, the 
fact that they have spoken 
language as a "least common 
denominator" allows them to 
sync up their algorithms by 

just sharing a few 
sentences.
Many of society's rules are 
entirely arbitrary but exist 
for good reasons, namely so 
that we can all coexist. 
There's no particular 
reason we drive on one side 
of the road or the other, or 
why red means stop and 
green means go. The point is 
simply that we all need to do 
certain things the same way 

or there is chaos. That also 
makes perfect sense.
Sometimes, however, 
demonstrations of conformity 
are required as a sort of 
test of one's commitment to 
the collective. The pledge 
of allegiance in the US is one 
example. If a student closes 
it out with "That's all 
folks" in Porky Pig's voice, 
well, that's a week of 
detention right there. And 
that's just one of many 

examples. Military officers 
must be saluted, prelates' 
rings must be kissed, and all 
must rise for the judge or 
be held in contempt of 
court. So, even contempt is 
criminalized. Religions have 
creeds that all the faithful 
dutifully recite every 
week, often in unison in a 
monotone, and they don't 
allow you to make a few 
edits here and there for 
brevity or clarity. If you go 
to a baseball game and the 

person singing the national 
anthem makes what they 
regard as a few 
improvements to it, they will 
literally be booed, and this 
act of nonconformity will be 
covered in the media the 
next day.
Grammar is another example 
of required conformity that 
becomes arbitrary when it 
goes beyond any practical 
requirement for 
communication. No one argues 

that the sentence, "I ain't 
never gonna do that" isn't 
coherent, just that it 
contains multiple errors. As I 
typed it just now, even 
Microsoft Word passed 
judgment on me with its smug 
little red squiggles. And 
yet, there is no objective 
right and wrong, at least in 
English. While some 
grammatical rules do promote 
clarity of meaning, much of 
what we call correct grammar 
is merely arbitrary 

convention. We're told not 
to end a sentence with a 
preposition and to never 
split our infinitives. The 
only justification offered is 
that that's the way we do 
it. We don't tolerate 
variants in spelling either, 
even if they are 
improvements over poorly 
spelled words. Why does 
"knife" still start with a 
kand "psychology" with a p? 
OK, there is at least one 
word where we do tolerate 

spelling variations, and 
that's okay.
Even groups of 
nonconformists conform with 
each other in how they 
don't conform. Those who 
reject the dominant 
conventions of their society 
often become conformists in 
a subgroup, wearing similar 
clothes or performing 
identical activities, and they 
in turn are often intolerant 

of deviations from those 
conventions.
There are a thousand tiny 
forms of conformity that we 
all follow reflexively 
because everyone else does. 
These are incredibly small, 
subtle things. But if 
someone begins to flout 
them, they really are making 
a statement that they are 
outside of the society, not 
part of it. Even the 
rejection of the most 

insignificant of these norms 
can be seen as a rejection of 
the whole. In some groups, 
simply wearing a bow tie when 
everyone else is wearing a 
straight tie will be noticed 
and judged unfavorably. If 
you decide to try to bring 
back the monocle or wearing a 
formal cape to events, well, 
kiss your career goodbye. 
Who knows what other 
deviant behavior you are 
hiding? Even innocuous acts 
of individuality that affect 

no one else—say, uncommon 
dietary practices—marks a 
person as an unpredictable 
loose cannon.
And that's the key word: 
unpredictable. That's the 
cardinal sin in a 
superorganism. After all, an 
engine only hums when all 
the parts are doing exactly 
what they are supposed to. 
If they aren't performing 
like the other ones, then 
they need to be replaced, 

and that's exactly what we 
do as well. We fire or shun 
or exclude the people who 
don't conform, even in areas 
where their deviations 
don't matter. It's the ant 
world again: If an ant acts 
weird, it gets killed. We 
aren't that harsh. We allow 
for nonconformity, but only 
when we are all doing it 
together. Noam Chomsky 
expressed a sentiment along 
these lines when he wrote, 
"The smart way to keep 

people passive and obedient 
is to strictly limit the 
spectrum of acceptable 
opinion, but allow very 
lively debate within that 
spectrum."
We have evolved a distrust 
of nonconformist behavior in 
general, but we have not yet 
learned to distinguish 
between harmful and 
harmless versions of it. The 
result is that we live in a 
highly regimented society 
where the range of actions 

that are socially acceptable 
is tightly defined, because, 
well, that's what it takes 
to make the superorganism 
hum.
If we are in fact part of a 
superorganism, then the 
organism itself is subject to 
evolution and evolves to fill 
some niche. What would 
Agora's niche be? Or, put 
another way, "Why are we 
here?"WHY ARE WE HERE?

WE EXPLORED EARLIER 
HOWsuperorganisms come into 
being. They begin as mutually 
beneficial partnerships and 
then coevolution takes it 
from there, leading to more 
specialization until one day a 
superorganism is formed. 
Thus, the initial purpose of 
the superorganism is solely 
to further the survival of 
the parts. Beehives, for 
instance, may well have 
formed to provide a safe 
haven for bees, and since 

the hive maintains a steady 
temperature, it provides an 
ideal home for its 
inhabitants.
Over time, the superorganism 
continues to evolve with its 
parts, becoming better suited 
to them, and they in turn 
evolve to help it. For 
example, beehives went on to 
evolve the ability to store 
large amounts of honey as a 
backup food source for the 
bees. In theory, the entire 

purpose of the 
superorganism can simply be 
to further the survival of 
its parts, but I don't know 
any case where this is true. 
What actually happens is 
that in addition to evolving 
with its parts, the 
superorganism also interacts 
with the larger world. It 
evolves in the context of its 
environment, and so as it 
evolves, it affects the 
world around it. It begins to 
fill its own ecological niche, 

influencing and being 
influenced by its 
surroundings. For example, 
the honey stored in beehives 
is a food source for other 
creatures besides the bees. 
This includes bears, honey 
badgers, bats, birds, and 
ants, to name but a few.
How do you spot the 
ecological niche that the 
superorganism fills? By 
studying its emergent 
properties. That's the wild 

card, the shiny new feature 
that affects its 
environment.
What then is the niche that 
Agora fills? What is its 
essential function? Well, 
what are its emergent 
properties? Answer: 
everything in the modern 
world. Everything we have 
today that we didn't have 
ten thousand years ago is 
due to Agora. Hold that 
thought for a minute.

We must seem like aliens to 
the other creatures on this 
planet. Our abilities, along 
with what we have built and 
accomplished, set us apart in 
a profound way from 
anything else alive. Have 
you ever wondered why it is 
just us? Shouldn't there be 
a whole host of creatures 
coming up behind us in terms 
of intelligence? A broad 
range of animals at every 
point on the developmental 

spectrum? Shouldn't there 
be some animals entering 
their Stone Age, and others 
their Bronze Age, and so 
forth? But nothing like that 
exists. Nothing even 1 
percent of where humans 
are at. If we see a chimp 
using a long blade of grass to 
get termites to snack on, we 
are amazed that it can use a 
tool. But come on . . . 
really? A blade of grass? 
That's supposed to be 
impressive?

What's holding the other 
creatures back? I wrote a 
book about that in which I 
argued it was that those 
animals lack a knowledge of 
the future and the past, so 
they couldn't plan. This was 
because they lacked episodic 
memory, that is, specific 
memories of past events. 
Humans gained the ability to 
do those things by virtue of 
a fortuitous genetic mutation 
that gave us not just those 
capabilities but all of the 

other human distinctives, 
including language and 
creativity.
Others have suggested 
different reasons that 
we're alone in our 
capabilities. Perhaps it turns 
out that you need four 
things to be a smart, 
successful, technology-
accumulating, culture-
building species: a big brain, 
fine motor control to 
manipulate a wide variety of 

objects, a long life in which 
to accumulate knowledge, 
and, finally, societal living 
so that ideas and information 
can be shared and passed 
down. If you miss just one of 
those, it just doesn't jell. 
Octopi have the first two—big 
brains and motor control—but 
they only live a couple of 
years and are solitary. 
Dolphins lack digits to 
manipulate their 
surroundings, so even if a 
dolphin could conceive of 

the telegraph, it could 
never build one. We just 
happened to be the 
creatures that drew four 
aces in a row and won the 
game.
But these are not 
explanations. They only kick 
the can down the street. 
Regardless of the feature 
that makes us unique, the 
question remains 
unanswered: Why just us? 
Why doesn't evolution make 

more things with episodic 
memory or opposable thumbs 
or the ability to plan or 
whatever it is that makes 
the magic happen? Why just 
one species?
To answer that, let's switch 
gears for a minute. What if 
there is a giant planetwide 
superorganism such as Gaia or 
something else like it? A 
living, breathing creature. 
Something that emerges from 
the totality of all life on 
Earth, unlike Agora, which is 

solely a superorganism of 
humans. What would that 
planetary superorganism 
want?
I happen to think that there 
is such a biological entity, 
but if you are not convinced, 
then let me reframe the 
same question: If the earth 
is simply an immense nonliving 
system of water cycles and 
carbon cycles and so forth, 
all combined into a single 
übersystem, what would it 
want? But wait . . . can a 

system "want" something? 
Yes, in the sense that it can 
have conditions under which 
it functions best. 
Colloquially, we speak this 
way, the way the owner of a 
sports car might say that the 
car "wants" to burn premium 
gasoline. But in more formal 
language we would think of 
it this way: Systems have 
feedback loops that they use 
to try to keep key 
parameters within ideal 
operating conditions. We saw 

this earlier in the ways that 
the earth's geological 
systems self-regulate, to 
try to keep certain 
parameters within a range of 
ideal values. In living 
systems, we call this 
homeostasis, and the bees 
who work to heat and cool 
the hive are trying to keep 
it in homeostasis. The 
equivalent term for 
nonliving systems is "steady 
state," which they "try" to 

maintain. They "want" to 
maintain that.
So, back to our question, what 
would such a planetary 
system "want," whether it 
is living or nonliving? There 
is a straightforward answer 
to this. If it is alive, or even 
behaves like a living system, 
then it probably wants what 
all other living things want: 
to thrive and to perpetuate, 
that is, to live and 
reproduce. It sure wouldn't 

want to die—that's way 
outside of its ideal 
parameters.
Should it be worried about 
dying? Absolutely. The 
planet upon which we all 
reside is little more than a 
speck of dust floating alone 
in the unending darkness of 
an infinite universe. A lot 
could kill it. It is a 
statistical certainty that at 
some point in the future, 
the earth is going to get 

walloped by some devastating 
celestial object. The 
asteroid that killed the 
dinosaurs, the Chicxulub 
impactor they call it, was 
about the size of Mount 
Everest, which doesn't 
sound all that big, but since 
it was traveling at twenty 
miles per second, it packed 
quite a punch. Those 
illustrations you've likely 
seen of two or three 
dinosaurs looking up at the 
big fireball in the sky as if 

to say, "This can't be 
good . . ." would have never 
happened, given its speed. 
With that in mind, consider 
that there are tens of 
thousands of near-Earth 
objects of various sizes that 
cross our orbit, so 
eventually we will hit every 
one of them as well.
We would probably survive a 
similar impact, as would 
other life-forms, but it 
wouldn't be pretty. Such an 

impact will happen again, but 
whether it will be in a 
hundred million years or a 
week from Tuesday is 
anyone's guess. NASA takes 
this threat seriously enough 
to embark on multiple 
projects designed to protect 
us from such a disaster by 
intercepting threatening 
objects and altering their 
course by a tiny fraction of a 
degree.

In a paper called "The 
Resilience of Life to 
Astrophysical Events," 
authors David Sloan, Rafael 
Alves Batista, and Abraham 
Loeb attempt to determine 
"what cataclysmic event 
could lead to the 
annihilation of not just 
human life but also 
extremophiles, through the 
boiling of all water in 
Earth's oceans." They find 
that "although human life is 
somewhat fragile to nearby 

events, the resilience of 
Ecdysozoa . . . renders global 
sterilisation an unlikely 
event." While this is 
undoubtedly good news if you 
happen to be an Ecdysozoan—
whatever that is—as a human 
I find it hard to take much 
comfort in their findings.
The authors analyze four 
existential planetary 
threats—supernovae, gamma-
ray bursts, large asteroid 
impacts, and passing-by stars

—and determine that while 
catastrophes are common, 
life so pervades our planet, 
deep into its crust in fact, 
that it would be hard to kill 
it all. But such a disaster 
could set life back so far 
that it might never recover
So it is reasonable to assume 
that a planetary 
superorganism would have a 
strong incentive to build 
some kind of defense against 
these threats, and the best 
way to do that—even with all 

the trouble we cause—is to 
spin up an intelligent 
species, perhaps one with 
opposable thumbs, long lives, 
social living, episodic memory, 
language, creativity, and 
planning skills who could 
come together to tackle that 
problem head-on, and would 
be highly motivated to do so 
as well. In short, the 
planetary superorganism 
would need us. Well, 
actually, it would need 
Agora.

To be clear, the planetary 
superorganism—Gaia or 
whatever—didn't make us. It 
isn't as if it fashioned the 
first humans from clay and 
breathed life into them. 
Rather it is to say that 
planetary-scale 
superorganisms that fail to 
evolve something like Agora 
to protect themselves from 
existential threats will 
inevitably die out. It also 
suggests something else a 

little unsettling—that 
superorganisms on planets 
where many different 
intelligent species evolve, 
each perhaps eventually 
becoming their own 
superorganism, also 
inevitably die out, probably 
by blowing themselves up.
You can see why we are a 
dangerous bet. Any species 
powerful enough to protect 
a planet from an asteroid is 
likely powerful enough to 

destroy that planet as well. 
We have deemed it a wise 
choice to manufacture tens 
of thousands of nuclear 
warheads—not merely just 
the few hundred that would 
be needed solely for a 
deterrent—and if that 
weren't enough, we've 
figured out how to engineer 
life-forms with life-
destroying properties. The 
answer to why we are the 
only smart ones on the 
planet could be that 

intelligence is volatile 
substance. It might be that 
life simply doesn't need our 
kind of intelligence at all, 
at least on a day-to-day 
basis. Sure, we might be 
needed to deflect the 
occasional asteroid, but 
otherwise intelligence might 
well be a hindrance to the 
perpetuation of life. Life 
seems to do better without 
it, and definitely no worse.

So whether we are talking 
about Gaia or a nonliving 
system is immaterial. The net 
in either case is that on any 
given planet, if no 
intelligent life ever 
happens to evolve, then 
that planet will get whacked 
by an asteroid. Likewise, if 
there is a planet where lots 
of intelligent life evolves, 
they might inevitably blow 
themselves up. The 
Goldilocks number of 
intelligent species might 

well be one. Just enough to 
keep asteroids at bay, and 
hopefully not enough to 
destroy itself.
However, the planet 
doesn't just need an 
intelligent species to build a 
rocket to deflect an 
asteroid. It only works at 
scale. It needs billions and 
billions of intelligent 
creatures of that species to 
accomplish its goal. Imagine if 
the population of intelligent 

humans never reached more 
than a thousand. You can't 
have the kind of innovation 
we have had—and certainly 
not as quickly as we have had 
it—without lots of people. 
The planet needs a bunch of 
us, because not only does it 
needs lots of hands to do 
that work, but it also needs 
the lightning in a bottle that 
is an Isaac Newton or an 
Albert Einstein to 
periodically come along and 
propel us forward. However, 

it can't have too many of us 
either, because we would 
quickly use up all our 
resources and burn 
ourselves out.
So, for the planet to 
survive, it needs exactly 
one intelligent species that 
is able to rapidly grow its 
population to some critical 
threshold without eating up 
all its resources. In other 
words, it has to grow fast 

and big, but not too fast nor 
too big.
So, maybe out of a billion 
planets, five just happen to 
evolve life. On one, it 
never becomes intelligent 
and that planet is destroyed 
by a cosmic event. On the 
second one, a plethora of 
intelligent species emerge 
and one of them inevitably 
blows the planet up. On the 
third, a single intelligent 
species evolves but never 

really achieves the critical 
mass of population needed to 
produce a superorganism as 
powerful as Agora, so it gets 
taken out by an asteroid as 
well. On the fourth, a 
single intelligent species 
evolves but grows so big so 
quickly it burns itself out 
and vanishes. And then 
there is the fifth one, and 
we call that one Earth.
So that covers the first of 
the two things a planetary 

superorganism might want: to 
survive. It needs Agora for 
that. What about 
reproduction? How could a 
planetary superorganism 
reproduce? You might recall 
from earlier, one of the 
arguments against the Gaia 
hypothesis was that there is 
no way for favorable 
mutations to persist because 
Gaia can't reproduce. How do 
we answer this?
Earlier, we explored 
panspermia, the idea that 

our DNA came here through 
space and, having landed on 
this planet, took root and 
transformed it. There are 
two versions of it, and the 
idea I am about to offer 
applies to both. Directed 
panspermia—the idea that 
this was a deliberate act—
seems like something an 
intelligent species might 
possibly want to do. Today 
NASA carefully sterilizes 
our planetary probes lest 
they inadvertently 

contaminate life in an alien 
ecosystem. But it isn't hard 
to imagine the opposite: that 
we decide to seed the 
universe with our life. This 
is not narcissism, rather the 
fulfillment of an obligation. 
If intelligent life is 
vanishingly rare, then those 
few planets endowed with it 
have a duty to spread it. 
Other planets need an Agora 
to protect them as well.

The second form of 
panspermia says it could just 
be accidental and actually 
might happen all the time. 
When a medium-sized 
asteroid hits the earth, it 
can throw matter into space, 
which can certainly contain 
biological matter. Is it 
unreasonable to believe that 
such matter could drift 
around until it happens to 
land on a new planet where 
it can take root? Many plants 
on Earth use this strategy 

to reproduce. They throw 
their pollen into the wind 
with confidence that a few 
specks of it will land on 
another member of their 
species. Wouldn't it be 
amazing if it turned out that 
plants and planets 
reproduced the same way? 
Life may be spreading 
through the universe this 
way. It would scale quite 
quickly, even with the vast 
distances involved. One 
planet seeds another, then 

the two become four, then 
the four become eight, and 
so on. The cosmos may be 
dripping with this sort of 
biological matter, which 
would explain why life 
started on Earth 
immediately after forming.
So that is the net of all of 
this. Superorganisms that 
produce technology-using 
intelligent creatures like us 
to defend them from cosmic 
threats live on, and those 

that don't become lifeless 
wastelands. Likewise, 
superorganisms that produce 
star-faring peoples 
reproduce by sending those 
people out into the cosmos. 
Planets or planetary 
superorganisms that don't do 
this die childless. It is just 
plain ole natural selection, 
only at a different scale. 
We are therefore the cosmic 
child of some other Agora, 
and our Agora will soon be 
able to reproduce as well. If 

this is correct, we will 
eventually find evidence of 
alien life, but it will be 
based on the same exact DNA 
that we have, and it will 
speak the language of GTCA.
So that's my thought on why 
we are here: to protect 
life. That's our ecological 
niche. What a wonderful job.
There is one last question I 
would like to address. Maybe 
you've asked yourself if 

planetary superorganisms are 
themselves just cells in a 
larger cosmic creature. If 
the universe is populated 
with many Agoras, are they 
also specialized, and in 
aggregate do they form an 
even higher superorganism?
On the one hand, it doesn't 
seem like there could be all 
that many Agoras quite yet. 
The universe is quite young—
just fourteen billionish 
years old—and since it took 
billions of years for our 

Agora to emerge and send 
people to space, it doesn't 
seem like there could have 
been too many generations 
before us.
On the other hand, Agora can 
have a near limitless number 
of siblings. DNA is famously 
easy to copy. It wouldn't 
take all that many billions 
of years to populate the 
cosmos that way. Even with 
today's primitive spacefaring 
technology, we could build 

probes that could go to 
every nook and cranny of 
the Milky Way, with its 
eighty-six billion stars, in 
just a few million years, 
which is essentially the 
blink of an eye at the time 
scales we are dealing with. 
But if this is true, we are 
returned to the Fermi 
paradox. If this is all 
happening, then why aren't 
DNA-bearing probes 
constantly zipping by our 

planet? Maybe they are, and 
we just don't see them.
Is it possible that Agora 
itself is a part of an even 
larger superorganism? 
Possible? Sure. But is there 
any evidence for that? 
Arguments in favor would be 
the sheer size of the 
universe and the number of 
planets in it. We don't know 
how many planets are in the 
Milky Way—it's certainly 
more than the number of 

neurons in your brain—but 
does that matter? Further, 
galaxies themselves are in 
clusters that could in turn 
be thought of as organs, and 
the total number of planets 
in the universe is likely 
about the same as the total 
number of cells in all 
humans—all eight billion—
combined. In support of this 
idea is that if life is nested 
levels of complexity, then 
there is no reason it can't 
be one more level higher.

All that said, regrettably, 
there can't be such a 
creature. Unless we are 
missing something big about 
the nature of reality, 
nothing suggests that these 
planets across the universe 
are somehow communicating or 
are even able to influence 
one another. Space just may 
be too big for the kind of 
intense communication, 
specialization, and 
collaboration that seem to be 

required to create an 
emergent universe-sized 
superorganism. 
Superorganisms emerge from 
the density of their parts 
coupled with the rapidity of 
their communication. The 
universe is the exact 
opposite of dense. It 
averages just one atom per 
every hundred gallons of 
empty space.
Plus, the time scales are all 
wrong. The billions of years 

it took to birth our Agora is 
already a big chunk of the 
universe's total age, and so 
the cosmic creature of which 
Agora is but a cell would 
have a life span of trillions 
of years, and we don't think 
the universe will last that 
long. Such a creature would 
be possible, but not in our 
realityTHE VERDICT
WHEN I STARTED WRITINGthis 
book, I didn't know what I 
thought about Agora. I 
introduced the idea and the 

name in the book Stories, 
Dice, and Rocks That Think: 
How Humans Learned to See 
the Future—and Shape It. At 
first, I envisioned it as a 
metaphor for how groups of 
people can do things that no 
individual could. But the 
idea really grabbed hold of 
me and I couldn't stop 
thinking about it, so I decided 
to write an entire book about 
Agora in which I tried to 
figure out what it was.

As I worked on the book and 
studied systems theory, I 
began to think of it as a real 
thing, as a system. Systems 
are made up of parts that 
interact with one another in 
prescribed and predictable 
ways. In doing so, they become 
a unified whole. The 
characteristics of a system 
are that they accept input, 
modify it in some way, 
produce output, and have 
mechanisms for constraining 
or limiting all of that. They 

also have a feedback 
mechanism that influences 
their future operation. 
Systems have boundaries that 
demarcate the limits of 
their influence.
What I learned is that they 
are everywhere. You can 
read back through that 
description of systems and, 
instead of a car or a clock, 
imagine the water cycle—how 
water evaporates, forms 
clouds, rains down, and so 

forth. Computer programs 
are systems, as are 
corporations. It is a versatile 
concept, and the fact that it 
describes so many things 
doesn't dilute the idea, but 
rather illustrates how 
pervasive systems are in our 
world. Agora seemed to fit 
all the requirements.
So at that point, I thought of 
Agora as a machine of sorts. I 
found this really 
interesting because if it is a 

machine, then it can be 
optimized, and it could also 
break. As I would read the 
news, I'd try to understand 
world events as if the whole 
of modernity were a system 
that was broken in places. I 
would ask myself why it 
wasn't functioning 
correctly. That is, what had 
failed?
William of Ockham, who lived 
about seven hundred years 
ago, was an English friar and 
philosopher. He coined what 

today we call Occam's razor. 
It really is one of the 
better razors. The idea is 
that the simplest 
explanation is most likely 
the true one. Or, put 
another way, the explanation 
with the fewest assumptions 
is most likely to be true. As I 
continued to write, I kept 
asking myself whether Agora 
was a simplifying assumption 
or an unneeded one. I found 
it to be quite useful for 
understanding the events of 

the world and human history 
in general.
The more I wrote, the more 
Agora felt like it was alive, 
like it was organic. It seemed 
to me to have something like 
a heartbeat, and I could see 
the systems of the world 
mapping as its various organs. 
I knew it was possible that it 
could be a creature because 
it was made of living parts, 
that is, us. So that led me to 
try to understand what 

constitutes a life-form, and 
that led me to studying 
superorganisms. Although as 
a beekeeper I was familiar 
with them in that context, I 
wanted to understand them 
in a general way. There is 
actually very little 
literature that does this; 
instead, most books are about 
ants or bees or the human 
body or Gaia, but few of 
them advance a general 
understanding of what makes 
a superorganism tick.

While I was immersed in all 
of this, I would walk around 
my native Austin, Texas, and 
that's when it really popped 
for me. I could see 
information encoded in the 
physical structures around 
me. I could see the city's 
inhabitants—the Uber 
drivers and restaurateurs I 
used in my examples—acting 
independently, giving rise to 
a superorganism, and I could 
spot emergent properties. 

That's when I came to 
believe that Agora is a living 
creature, and since at that 
point the idea of planetary 
superorganism was no longer 
a stretch, I came to 
understand Gaia as a living 
creature, an emergent being 
made up of all of the life in 
the world. Again, these are 
not religious beliefs but 
simply ones about biology. If 
cells can make bees, and bees 
can make beehives, well, 
there's no reason that 

would be the highest level 
possible. I think the levels 
go all the way up to the 
planetary level. And just 
because something is a far 
more complex form of life, 
that doesn't make it a god.
In fact, Agora shouldn't 
even be that much of a leap. 
Imagine if you lived 
centuries ago and read the 
findings of Robert Hooke, 
which we discussed at the 
beginning of this book. He was 

one of the scientists who 
popularized the idea that we 
are made of cells. Imagine 
that. You lived your whole 
life thinking it was just you 
in your body, and then this 
guy comes along and says you 
are made of countless small 
creatures. While that may 
have blown people's minds, 
it wasn't a cause for an 
existential crisis. Neither is 
Agora, for it is the same sort 
of mental shift, a reframing 

of how we understand the 
world.
Is Agora conscious? That's 
the tricky one, and of 
course no one knows. No one 
knows if anything other than 
themselves is. If our 
consciousness is an emergent 
phenomenon related to our 
complexity, then Agora, being 
even more complex than us, 
would likely be conscious. 
But complexity may not be 
what gives rise to 

consciousness. I don't even 
know if IhopeAgora is 
conscious or not. It's enough 
for me to understand it as a 
living creature, one that we 
should all work to nurture 
and cherish, because, well, 
it's us. It isn't that there 
is "us" and there is 
"Agora," rather that we are 
Agora—a realization that gave 
me the title for this book.
That's my conclusion. What 
was yours? If you are so 

inclined, please drop me a 
note. My email address is 
byronreese@gmail.comand I 
would love to hear from you.
We have one final topic to 
cover in this book: Does any 
of this actually matter in a 
practical day-to-day sense? I 
think it does. I think 
understanding Agora helps us 
understand human history 
and that in turn gives us a 
way to speculate on our 
collective future. I also 

think it has profound 
implications on how we should 
live and interact with one 
another. We cover all of 
this in our final three 
chapters: "The Past," "The 
Present," and "The 
Future."SECTION IV
MEANINGTHE PAST
WE'VE HAD WRITING 
FORabout five thousand 
years, and so that is as far 
back as our records go. 
Anything before that is 
termed prehistoric, and what 

happened then must be 
inferred from archeological 
remains. To help us try to 
comprehend those five 
millennia of recorded 
history, we divide it into 
eras and areas, such as 
"home life in colonial 
America" or "Ming Dynasty 
agricultural methods," and 
even as specific as those 
topics are, one can spend a 
lifetime studying them and 
only scratch the surface of 
what could be known. The 

challenge isn't that 
recorded history is all that 
long—it's just a blink of an 
eye, really—but that a 
hundred billion people have 
lived and died in that short 
time.
There's an alternative 
approach to understanding 
the past known as Big History 
that attempts to take it all 
in at once, to view it from 
thirty-five thousand feet, 
with the hope that from 

such a height, we can spot 
the overall themes of 
history and understand the 
forces that move it along.
This book tries to 
understand our history that 
way, as the biography of 
Agora. Agora was born just 
before we developed writing, 
and so while our history 
doesn't document its birth, 
it does contain an account of 
its childhood and beyond. And 

the overall theme of that 
story, I think, is progress.
Progress. What does that 
even mean? In the broadest 
terms, it means going from 
something bad to something 
better. This means it's a 
value judgment. But since 
people have different 
values, is there any common 
ground to be had? Is there 
anything that we can 
universally regard as 
progress? I think so. As 

President Kennedy so 
eloquently put it, "In the 
final analysis, our most basic 
common link is that we all 
inhabit this small planet. We 
all breathe the same air. We 
all cherish our children's 
future. And we are all 
mortal."
Kennedy only touched on a 
few of these common values, 
but there are many more. 
Life is better than death, 
freedom is better than 
tyranny, knowledge is better 

than ignorance, health is 
better than sickness, peace 
is better than war, and 
kindness is better than 
cruelty. There are many 
things in the world that are 
bad, such as hunger, pain, 
misery, suffering, 
desperation, greed, and 
hatred, and many that are 
wonderful, including 
happiness, joy, health, 
friendship, hope, harmony, 
and love.

Are there those who would 
disagree with these values? 
Sure. A few. Perhaps 6 
percent. I know, that's an 
oddly specific number, but 
here's how I got it: A few 
years back, Clemson 
University student Nathan 
Weaver was studying how to 
help turtles get across 
roads. As part of this 
effort, he placed a rubber 
turtle on the side of a road 
as if it were trying to cross, 
and saw that 6 percent of 

drivers deliberately 
swerved to hit it. A turtle. 
A harmless turtle.
Some would argue that the 
real number is even higher 
than that, and there were 
probably lots of people who 
just didn't notice the 
turtle or didn't want to 
damage their car. Some 
believe that evil people 
abound in great numbers, and 
that the Big History is 
actually not a story of 

progress, but an unending 
struggle between two 
opposing value systems, the 
one I describe above and its 
antithesis, one that sees 
hate as better than love. 
But the idea of Agora 
doesn't support this view, 
for a superorganism can't be 
at war with itself. We don't 
see anything in nature 
resembling a beehive where 
half the bees are plotting to 
kill the other half. Rather, 

we see a story of 
coevolution and cooperation.
I agree with Marcus Aurelius, 
who must have been thinking 
of something like Agora when 
he wrote the following 
passage nearly two thousand 
years ago in his book 
Meditations. I have 
paraphrased the text from 
my copy of George Long's 1910 
translation of it, and I have 
included the original in the 

back of this book for your 
reference:
When you wake up in the 
morning, say to yourself, 
"Today I shall meet 
ungrateful, arrogant, 
deceitful, envious, unkind 
people. They are this way 
because they don't 
understand the difference 
between good and evil. But I 
have seen them both up 
close and know that good is 
beautiful and evil is ugly. 
And I understand that the 

person who chooses evil is 
just like me—not outwardly 
of course—but has the same 
mind that I have, and he too 
carries within himself a piece 
of the divine. He cannot 
hurt me because he cannot 
make me choose evil, but nor 
can I be angry with him or 
hate him. For we were born 
to work together, to 
cooperate like parts of the 
same body. So it would be 
wrong for me to harm him, 
and if I were to turn my back 

on him instead of helping 
him, that would be a 
harmful act."
Yes. There are people who 
choose evil, and it would be 
wrong of us to turn our 
backs on them. But most 
people have seen good and 
know that is beautiful, and 
they do share the set of 
values I listed earlier and 
have throughout history. 
And those values should be 
the yardstick by which we 
measure our progress.

So, by such a yardstick, have 
things gotten better or 
worse over the last five 
thousand years? Definitely 
better. Not for everyone. 
Not constantly. Not 
everywhere. Not without 
setbacks. And not nearly as 
fast as we would want. But 
on balance, over time, inch by 
inch, I think we are becoming 
just a little bit better 
every day.

Is that true? Or just 
something we wish were 
true? Let's list some of it 
out and see if it is 
convincing. Over five 
thousand years of recorded 
history, we've decreased 
many evils: hunger, poverty, 
infant mortality, death by 
violence, death by disease, 
ignorance, illiteracy, 
slavery, and war. We've also 
increased many things that 
are good: life expectancy, 
self-government, access to 

education, individual liberty, 
legal equality, and wealth. 
In much of the world, we've 
outlawed child abuse and 
child labor, along with 
cruelty to animals. While 
doing all of that, we were 
also working to end legal 
slavery, the legal status of 
women as chattel, legal 
discrimination by race, public 
torture and executions, 
debtors' prison, and 
mutilations as punishment. 
We have created democracy, 

human rights, presumption of 
innocence, trial by jury, 
rule of law, habeas corpus, 
and due process. We invented 
the idea of free speech and 
codified it in many places 
around the world, along with 
freedom of the press and 
freedom of religion. We 
enshrined our values in 
documents that work to 
guarantee liberty and limit 
tyranny. While all that was 
happening, still others were 
inventing ways to prevent 

disease, ease the hard toils 
of life, grow more food, and 
expand access to information.
While critics could argue 
with any of these, it is hard 
to refute them all, and 
they become all the more 
compelling when you realize 
just how bad things used to 
be. We are attuned to the 
shortcomings of our time, 
keenly aware of our own 
moral failings, and it is right 
that we should be so, for 

they are the only problems 
we have any hope of solving. 
But as bad as things 
sometimes seem, it is hard 
for us as moderns to imagine 
the cruelty that used to be 
the norm. I don't even know 
where to begin to describe it: 
The smallest offenses used 
to be capital crimes, 
mutilations were normal 
punishments, torture was a 
form of mainstream 
entertainment in which 
people were skinned alive 

for the spectacle of it. A 
city that lost a war would 
have all its men killed, all 
its children sold into 
slavery, and its women 
regarded as spoil. Centuries 
ago in France, there was a 
popular pastime known as cat 
burning, where crowds of 
people cheered as live 
animals were thrown into a 
bonfire. And finally, about 
the same time, when a 
rebellion against the Kingdom 
of Hungary by a man named 

György Dózsa failed, he was 
made to sit on a red-hot iron 
throne, hold a red-hot 
scepter, and his followers, 
who had been starved 
beforehand, were made to 
pull pliers from a fire, rip 
the flesh off his living 
body, and eat it.
What changed from that time 
to ours? Aurelius would say 
that we gradually have 
learned to tell the 
difference between good and 

evil, and in doing so, we 
discovered that good was 
beautiful, and we went 
toward it. But how did that 
come about? Through Agora.
Think about Agora's history 
and the ways it brought 
about the progress listed 
above. That history began 
several thousand years ago 
when people started moving 
into cities. These required 
governments. Governments 
were tasked with preserving 

order, and this was done 
with legal codes that were 
clear and, generally 
speaking, enforced. As 
individuals we began to cease 
being laws unto ourselves 
and were no longer the 
judge, jury, and executioner 
of our private legal codes. 
We became part of a 
community. Individual 
motivations must have 
varied, but whether it was 
for safety or wealth or 
something else, we saw some 

benefit to coming together, 
like our two selfish bees 
earlier, and we doubled 
down on what was working. We 
specialized and through that 
became less independent and 
more reliant on each other, 
and Agora was born.
Commerce grew, strangers 
ceased being threats within 
the safety of the collective 
with its rules and norms, and 
instead they became 
customers and business 

partners, offering more 
opportunities for wealth. 
Increased prosperity led to 
increased leisure time, which 
led to more education and 
thus more literacy. This in 
turn led to the development 
of the press, with its ability 
to galvanize opinion, and this 
spread of knowledge acted as 
a check on tyranny. 
Widespread literacy gave rise 
to science, which displaced 
human superstitions. The 
safety of the city allowed 

different groups to 
commingle, and first-person 
experiences dispelled many 
of the prejudices and biases 
that were held in more 
insular times. New ideas were 
brought in that mixed with 
old ones, and slowly we 
realized the world was a 
more complicated place than 
we had thought, and that 
our ideas and beliefs 
required more nuance. Moral 
absolutism waned and the 
vacuum was gradually filled 

with tolerance. I can go on 
and on, but this is ground 
we've already trod.
We still have much work to 
do, but that shouldn't 
discourage us. Bees and ants 
have had fifty million years 
to get their superorganism 
right, and we are less than 
ten thousand years in on 
ours.
It's tempting to speculate on 
the reasons that our great-

grandchildren will look upon 
us with shame, which they 
likely will. Our descendants 
will measure us using the 
same yardstick that we are 
using, and they will find us 
lacking. From their vantage 
point, they may judge us 
because we built prisons in 
which to raise animals to eat, 
who lived short, miserable 
lives, and how we tried to 
keep it all out of sight so we 
didn't have to think about 
it. Or it might be because we 

built prisons to hide away 
the problem people and keep 
them out of sight for the 
same reason. Or, it might be 
that we slept in soft beds 
with clear consciences in a 
world with a billion hungry 
people who could have been 
fed with little sacrifice. Or 
how we built weapons that 
could only be aimed at one 
possible target: each other. 
Or, how we made war a for-
profit business.

I don't know which of these 
it will be. Maybe all of 
them, or maybe something we 
are completely blind to right 
now. But I hope they will 
regard us as monsters, 
because if they do, just 
imagine how much progress 
that means Agora will have 
made. They will be much 
better than us at telling 
the difference between good 
and evil, and, if all goes 
well, their great-

grandchildren will regard 
them as monsters, too.
But enough on history. How 
does Agora help us navigate 
our lives today? Let's 
look.THE PRESENT
CARL SAGAN ONCE OFFEREDa 
solution to the Fermi 
paradox, that is, why we 
don't see signs of aliens 
everywhere if the universe 
is teeming with life. He said 
that maybe upon developing 
the kind of modern 

technology that we have, a 
species has about a century—
that's a guess, of course—to 
either rein in their 
destructive behavior and 
live on for billions of years 
or blow themselves up.
It is the vanity of every age 
to think that they live at 
some great turning point in 
history. That said, we 
actually do live at a great 
turning point in history. If 
Sagan is correct, humanity is 

currently in that narrow 
window of time when we have 
the technology to destroy 
ourselves but may not yet 
have the wisdom to know how 
to avoid doing so
So how do we do it? How do we 
keep from self-destructing 
before we make it to the 
Billion Year Club?
In 1948, English astronomer 
Fred Hoyle predicted that 
"once a photograph of the 
Earth, taken from the 
outside, is available, a new 

idea as powerful as any in 
history will be let loose." 
He was right. In the decades 
that followed, we got 
increasingly better views of 
the whole planet "from the 
outside," each one more 
perspective altering than 
the last. Then, once people 
began going into space and 
seeing it firsthand, they 
found themselves changed 
by the experience. Author 
Frank White coined the term 
"the Overview Effect," and 

said that many returning 
astronauts had experienced 
changes in how they saw the 
world. These changes 
included, per White, "a 
feeling of awe, a profound 
understanding of the 
interconnection of all life, 
and a renewed sense of 
responsibility for taking care 
of the environment."
Sagan, too, felt that a 
perspective shift was 
necessary for humanity to 
save itself from 

destruction. In that spirit, 
he lobbied NASA to signal the 
distant Voyager 1 probe to 
turn its camera back toward 
Earth and take a photo, and 
they obliged. From such a 
vast distance, the earth was 
only a pale blue dot, all 
alone against a giant black 
canopy of empty space. The 
photo, named "the Pale Blue 
Dot," has no scientific value 
but enormous emotional 
value, because from that 
vantage point it shows that 

we are unquestionably one 
people who will share a 
single fate, and that what 
we view as our epic conflicts 
are really just petty 
squabbles. As Sagan put it, 
"There is perhaps no better 
demonstration of the folly 
of human conceits than this 
distant image of our tiny 
world. To me, it underscores 
our responsibility to deal 
more kindly with one 
another, and to preserve 
and cherish the pale blue 

dot, the only home we've 
ever known."
We've probed the limits of 
reductionism multiple times 
throughout this book—that 
how trying to understand 
something by looking at its 
parts can make you miss the 
whole. Sometimes you do have 
to take a step back to see a 
thing in its entirety to 
understand it. The Overview 
Effect is an example of 
this. Those astronauts who 
were moved by seeing Earth 

from space had seen the 
very same Earth their 
entire lives, just from 
ground level. But seeing it 
all, in one image, out of one 
window, in all its majesty and 
glory, was somehow 
different.
I think of Agora like that. 
I've spent my entire life 
looking at its parts, that is, 
the people I came in contact 
with, but I had never 
perceived them as a whole. 

Standing back and seeing one 
single creature, Agora, has 
given me a new view of 
humanity.
We are timid creatures, and 
understandably so. In the 
distant past, that paid a 
whole lot better than being 
bold ones. If we saw a large 
shape off in the distance on 
a foggy morning, there were 
two things we could do. Panic 
and run off, fearing that it 
was a bear, or stand fast, 

optimistically assuming it was 
just a large rock. It was 
almost always a rock, of 
course. That said, every now 
and then, it was a bear, and 
when it was, it was only the 
optimists—along with their 
optimistic genes—who got 
eaten. The effects of that 
culling are still with us 
today.
Our fearful nature 
expresses itself as an 
instinctual distrust of things 

that could be threats to us, 
and at the top of that list 
are other humans. We lived 
so long in small bands 
comprised solely of our 
relatives, who by and large 
looked like us, that we got 
used to that. Today, we are 
still just as tribal. The 
passion with which people 
identify with certain groups 
bears testimony to this. I'm 
not talking about nations and 
religions here, although 
that is obviously true. I mean 

the intensity with which 
people identify with a 
political party or a sports 
team. In a world where riots 
break out at sporting events, 
what hope do we have to get 
along with people who are 
unlike us in much deeper 
ways?
Sure, there are two 
hundred human universals—
those behaviors that are 
common to all human societies
—but that's not what 

evolution has bred us to 
notice.
What's the solution to this 
problem? Should we appeal to 
people's nobler instincts and 
say, "Why can't we all just 
get along?" That hasn't 
worked so far. It's been 
shopped around by a lot of 
people for a long time, and 
folks aren't lining up 
around the block wanting 
more of it.

Perhaps Agora might provide 
a path out of this dilemma. 
Understanding how Agora 
operates means 
understanding that not only 
do we share common 
interests, but that we are 
part of the same creature, 
the same literal animal. The 
left hand doesn't have to 
admire the right ear—it 
doesn't even have to like it
—but it can come to realize 
that the right ear is part of 
the same creature as it is, 

and if that creature dies, 
well, all the rest of the 
parts, including the left 
hand, die as well. There is 
no possibility for one of 
them to win and the other to 
lose.
My hope is that Agora will 
reframe how we think about 
each other. It doesn't gloss 
over our differences; 
rather it connects us with 
the simple truth that, like 

it or not, we are all going to 
share the exact same fate.
Ahh . . . but what fate? 
That's the question, right? 
And that is also the final 
chapter in our long journey 
together.THE FUTURE
MAYBE YOU'VE HEARD 
ABOUTa 1972 plane crash in 
the Andes. On this charter 
flight were forty-five 
passengers and crew, 
including eighteen members 
of the Old Christians Club 

rugby union, a team based in 
Uruguay. Because of an 
error by the inexperienced 
copilot, the plane began to 
descend while still fifty 
miles from the airport. Given 
that they were over a 
mountain range at the time, 
things went poorly. The 
plane crashed, shearing off 
both front wings as well as 
the back of the fuselage. 
Several people died on 
impact, and several more 
would die in the coming weeks 

from their injuries and the 
incredibly harsh conditions, 
which included more than 
one blizzard. Eleven days 
into the ordeal, the captain 
of the rugby team, twenty-
two-year-old Nando Parrado, 
listening to their only 
working radio, learned that 
the search for them had 
been called off. They had 
been given up for dead. He 
ran to tell the others, 
saying, "There's some good 
news! We just heard on the 

radio. They've called off 
the search." The others 
responded, "Why in the 
world is that good news?" 
Nando replied, "Because it 
means that we're going to 
get out of here on our own."
When I first read this 
account, I wondered if it was 
true. Did Nando reallysay 
that? And if so, did he 
believe it? A testament to 
the amazing world we live in 
is that within five minutes 
of asking myself these 

questions, I found his email 
address and put them to the 
man himself. The next 
morning, I had my answers. 
The quote was accurate, and 
on the question of why he 
said it, he wrote to me, 
"Given the conditions and 
fear of the unknown 
future, I could not come 
with something better..! 
Horrible news, that I tried 
to minimize . . ."
I understand that. He was 
rallying the troops. But 

what he evidently didn't 
understand at the time was 
that the news they got on 
the radio actually wasgood 
news, because it made them 
stop looking to the sky for 
their salvation, and once 
they did that, they had only 
one other place that they 
could look for it: within 
themselves. Once they 
realized there would be no 
rescue plane to save them, 
then they could get to work 
on the real task at hand: 

saving themselves. So 
whether Nando was sincere 
or not doesn't matter; what 
matters is that he was right. 
Those rugby players did just 
that: they saved 
themselves.
In the previous chapter, I 
quoted from Carl Sagan's 
commentary on the Pale Blue 
Dot photo. He closed it with, 
"In our obscurity, in all this 
vastness, there is no hint 
that help will come from 

elsewhere to save us from 
ourselves. It is up to us."
Sagan's message to us is the 
same one that Nando heard 
on his radio. It tells us in no 
uncertain terms that there 
is no rescue plane coming to 
save the human race. We are 
totally on our own. And you 
know what? That's good 
news. It means that we are 
going to save ourselves.
Today, our world faces 
seemingly insurmountable 

challenges. Our situation is 
grim; our lives hang in the 
balance. Many have lost hope 
and have given up. But the 
message of this book is that 
though our challenges are 
great, we are more than up 
to the task of overcoming 
them. Or, as Nando might put 
it, "we're going to get out 
of this on our own."
This is not rose-colored 
optimism nor a "We can do it" 
pep talk. I am not trying to 
rally anyone. I base this 

prediction on facts; and, as 
we reach the end of our 
journey together, I would 
like to share my reasoning 
with you.
Think for a moment just how 
fragile humanity used to be, 
how precarious our situation 
was. Let's go back just ten 
thousand short years and 
assess that world and our 
place in it. At that time, 
there were just a few 
million of us, scattered 

around the globe in tiny 
groups that had almost no 
contact with each other. 
There was no science, no 
writing, no metallurgy, 
hardly any technology to 
amplify our abilities. There 
weren't medicines beyond a 
few herbs, no vaccines, no 
cures, nor even any idea 
what disease really was. 
Each person was just a 
mosquito bite away from 
malaria, a scratch away from 
sepsis, and one unlucky 

injury away from a slow and 
painful death. Women 
commonly died in childbirth, 
children even more commonly 
died in their first year, and 
men fared little better, 
most dying young as well. We 
lived in the elements, and 
were hunted by creatures 
stronger, faster, and more 
ferocious than us. Every day 
was a struggle to survive, 
every night a terror of 
sounds and shapes. We had no 
cities, no walls to protect us, 

no governments, no law 
codes, no books, no 
accumulated knowledge but 
the little we could 
remember and pass down. In 
our ignorance, superstition 
must have ruled our lives, 
and the world must have 
been a frightening place. 
Lightning and thunder would 
have been terrifying, as 
would wind and storms. How 
confusing life would have 
been, how capricious death 
must have seemed.

And yet we made it. We got 
through it.
Now consider us today in all 
our glory, in our power and 
might. I won't go through 
that litany—you can look 
around the world and see us 
numbered in the billions, and 
marvel at our mastery of 
the planet, our monumental 
accomplishments, our 
inexhaustible knowledge, and 
our magnificent technical 

achievements. You already 
know that we live in a world 
where breakthroughs in 
science come so quickly no one 
can even know the tiniest 
fraction of them, and how a 
thousand things that would 
have seemed like miracles to 
our forebears are now parts 
of our daily lives.
Am I exaggerating even the 
tiniest bit?
Agora is staggeringly 
powerful and grows more so 

by the moment. We can now 
face anything that fate can 
throw at us, and we can 
overcome it . . . but only if 
we are willing to work 
together to do it. That's 
the trick, that's the power 
of a superorganism. But what 
exactly does that mean on a 
practical level?
When each of, as individuals, 
stops and considers our own 
place in Agora, it is easy to 
feel tiny and 
inconsequential. After all, 

there are billions of us who 
make up Agora, many of whom 
are renowned for their 
accomplishments, for what 
they have built or 
discovered. There are all 
those famous people whose 
names we all know who seem 
to be the ones doing the 
important work while the 
rest of us are living out our 
regular lives, caught up in 
the daily struggle of just 
getting by.

But it would be a mistake to 
think of Agora that way. 
That's just not how 
superorganisms work. What 
they achieve is done through 
the interactions of their 
parts, not because of some 
genius bee or overachieving 
ant. The power people are 
not the backbone of Agora; 
they aren't any more 
important than anyone else. I 
know that might not seem to 
make sense, or maybe it 
seems like I am being 

patronizing, but it is 
completely true. Are the 
biggest gears the most 
important parts of the clock? 
No. The clock keeps time 
because of all of the parts, 
big and small.
This is what really makes 
Agora work: There's a 
kindergarten teacher who 
encourages a child, who grows 
up to paint a mural that 
brightens someone's day as 
they drive past it, who, in 

turn drops back a bit in 
traffic to let the car in 
front of them change lanes, 
whose occupant thereby 
arrives to work in a slightly 
better mood, and is thus able 
to comfort a coworker who is 
struggling at home, and on, 
and on and on, year by year. 
All of these sorts of small 
acts are what sustain Agora, 
not the noisy people doing 
the glitzy things. By itself, 
any one of these acts of 
kindness is tiny, and is 

probably done reflexively, 
without thought, but when 
they occur by the billions 
every day, that's what 
brings Agora to life, that's 
what makes it strong.
"But wait," you may be 
thinking. "Let's not be 
overly sentimental here. 
The sequences of events 
that our good actions set in 
motion can just as easily 
result in harm, right? We 
can't be sure how it will all 

play out because we can't 
anticipate even one step 
ahead, let alone a 
hundred."
Shortly after World War II, 
Dr. Jerome Motto, a 
psychologist who specialized 
in the study of suicide, 
visited the apartment of a 
man who had just killed 
himself by jumping off the 
Golden Gate Bridge. The 
deceased had been single, in 
his thirties, and lived alone. 
But he had left a note on 

his desk, addressed to no one 
in particular, just for 
whoever happened to find it. 
It read:
"I'm going to walk to the 
bridge. If one person smiles 
at me on the way, I will not 
jump."
Superorganisms can only 
thrive when the parts work 
in harmony, cooperating with 
each other, assisting one 
another. In humans, this 
behavior comes not from 
instincts but emotions, 

specifically love, compassion, 
and empathy, all of which 
affirm life. How do you 
think we made it through 
those hard times ten 
thousand years ago? Through 
ruthless utilitarianism? A 
fierce survival-of-the-
fittest mentality? A dog-
eat-dog view of life? No. 
Just the opposite: through 
love, compassion, and 
empathy. This is not 
romanticism on my part. 
Archeological remains from 

that time show many people 
who clearly had sustained 
injuries that required 
constant care, and yet we can 
tell by the way their bones 
grew afterward that they 
lived on for years. We see 
repeated examples of adults 
from that era who had been 
born with debilitating 
conditions that would have 
prevented them from being 
able to contribute to the 
group at all, and yet they 
lived into adulthood. We see 

the skeletons of elderly 
people who must have been 
unable to walk for years 
before their death, but 
they were not put out to 
die. We made it through 
those hard times because we 
were kind to each other, 
because we helped each 
other.
So, OK, sure. We can't know, 
for certain, that our kind 
acts will result in good ends, 
but we can be confident that 

they almost always will. A 
loving, selfless act doesn't 
ripple through the world 
and somehow promote hate 
and division. It simply 
doesn't. Someone might be 
able to construct a 
carefully contrived scenario 
involving baby Hitler or 
something, but these are 
just arguments used by 
people who want to justify 
their own unkindness, or, at 
best, their own apathy. In 

truth, kind acts do promote 
life.
So back to those great 
challenges that we as a 
species face. We will 
overcome them not through 
some scientific breakthrough 
or due to a charismatic 
leader but by countless acts 
of life-affirming kindness, 
which in aggregate vitalize 
Agora, who is more than up to 
any task. Thus our collective 
fate depends on our innate 

goodness, which we can be 100 
percent certain exists, 
because if it didn't, we 
never would have made it 
this far. We never would 
have gotten out of that 
world of ten thousand years 
ago.
Isn't it a wonderful truth 
that the emotions that come 
naturally to a child—
kindness and empathy—turn 
out to be the most powerful 
forces in the universe? For 

they promote life, and 
collectively life becomes 
Agora, which exists to 
protect and spread more 
life.
If you've ever felt like you 
aren't living up to your 
potential, or that you should 
be doing more with your life, 
I suggest you move past all 
that. Remember that no part 
of a superorganism can 
comprehend the whole. Agora 
is far too big for any single 

person to shape or move. 
Instead, it can only be 
influenced by small acts of 
kindness done in great 
numbers. So, put no heavier 
burden on yourself other 
than to be as kind as you can 
be, and try every day to be a 
slightly better person than 
you were yesterday. That 
really is all it takes to build 
utopia.
We can build a better world, 
and then build an even 

better one, and then one 
even better than that. 
Until one morning we wake up 
in a world we cannot imagine 
any better. And that is the 
world we will take to the 
stars, spreading it to a 
billion planets, populating 
each with a billion people, 
each of whom is empowered 
to live their best possible 
life.
We really can do this. How do 
I know?

Because we are Agora.
