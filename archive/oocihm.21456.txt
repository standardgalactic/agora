INTRODUCTION.
•4'
III the early part of this year,
tlic Petworth Emigration
Conunittee, being
assured
of a
continuation
of the
liberal
support of the Earl of Egreniont, again made preparations to
send a
party of Emigrants, from the western part of Sussex,
to Toronto, late York, Upper Canada.
On this occasion, the Earl of Chichester expressed a
wish
to place under the same management, a considerable number
of persons, who had been enabled by his kind assistance, and
that of some neighbouring genv.lemen,
to emigrate from the
more eastern part of the county, and the committee felt much
pleasure in meeting his Lordships views.
It has from the first, been their anxious wish, to obtain every
possible information (not merely for
their own guidance, but
for the
benefit of the
public
at
large) which might tend to
smooth the emigrants passage to Canada, and tho' no expence
had been spared, on the former occasions,they had been disap-
pointed of obtaining full knowledge, on many desirable points.
They therefore considered themselves
particularly fortunate,
in having prevailed on Mr. Brydone, to take charge
of the
whole party.
That gentleman's
established
character
in
his Majesty's
service, and experience of nearly thirty years, as a naval me*
dical man, and a knowledge of his private worth, by one mem~

ber of the Committee, founded on a long acquaintance, afford-
ed an assurance, that every effort would be made on hiu
part,
toc''.M:ythe
emigrants
safely,
and comfortably,
to
their
ultimate destination
:
and
as Mr. Brydone had, in the early
part
of his
life, been practically ac(iuaintcd with farming, in
Scotland, and as he had, at a later period, made a very extend-
ed journey in the interior of Australia, he was peculiarly well
qualified to form a correct opinion of the nature of the country
to which he was about to proceed, and to point out the mcst
eligible spots for location.
The Committee therefore deeming
it inexpedient to
fetter
his
exertions, by any
very
detailed
instructions, gave him only the few general ones which follow.
I'etworth 14th. April, 1834.
Instructions of the
Petworth
Emigration
Committee^
to
J. M. Brydone Esq.
their superintendent in the British
Tar.
*The Conunittee having first originated aiul hitherto steadily

plan of conveying such emigrants as are placed

distance
to York,
in
Upper Canada,
instead
of turning them adrift,
as
had been
before done,
at the out
ports
;
and
the
superiority
of the
plan, having been fully proved, by the very satisfactory results
that have ensued ; they are the more anxious to persevere in
it
; and entrust its execution to Mr. Brydone
on this occa-
sion, with
peculiar
satisfaction ;
and, well assured as they
feel, that Mr. Brydone will exercise all practicable economy,
they hope, that he will not be deterred from a full performance

Mr.
Brydone will
first com-
inunicjitc with A. U. Iliiwke,
Esq. tlu" govcnuuent agent for
emigrants in that city, who
will probahly attend him to

on the Governor.
From Mr. liawke, Mr. Brydone will
re-
ceive the
best information, and
such
assistance
as may
be
necessary,
towards
the
forwarding
the
emigrants
to
the
different
places,
to which
they may
wish
(having
friends
already
settled
there)
to proceed, or which may be recom-
mended
to them
by
the
Government,
as
likely
to
afford
advantageous locations, or profitable employment.
The Committee
wish
to
recjmmend

Mr.
Brydonc's
peculiar care, on their arrival
at York,
U. C. any
boys,
or
lads, who may be
placed under
his charge, and who do
not
belong
to any
families going out,
and to
use every effort in
his power, towards placing them with masters of good cha-
racter,
and, where
practicablt*,

apprenticed.
Mr. Brydone is requested to keep a particular account of the
destination

different
families, and individuals, and to.
communicate the same to the Committee."

NARRATIVE.
The BRITISH tar,
a.
l, 3S3 Tons, commanded by
Captain
Robert
Crawford, had been taken up by the Com-
mittee,
for the conveyance
of emigrants
to
Montreal, and
had been fitted up,
xm
a substantial manner, with
a double
row of berths, six feet square, the whole length of the vessel
from the
partition,
or bulkhpad of the Captain's cabin, to
that which bounded the space for the seamen.
A
partition was
built
across the
ship,
before
the main
hatchway, and
another
abaft the main mast, by which, the
portion appropriated to the emigrants, was divided into three
parts, each having
its own
separate
access,
namely, by the
fore, main, and after hatchways.
The division forward, was appropriated to the boya, above
fourteen years of age, and
single men
:
the other two to the
•|
families
:
the
partition between
which, was so constructeii|
i
as to give a
separate water closet to each of these divisions,
k
thereby
avoiding the
risk, and
inconvenience,
especially ta
females and children, or others
in
delicate
health, attendant
on going on deck in bad weather, and at the same time se-
curing perfect cleanliness and comfort.
By
this arrangement,
either
of these
divisions could,
if
required,
have
been
readily
appropriated
as
intermediate
berths, to persons
rather above the conunon class,
or, in the
I
event
of
sickness,
during
the
voyage, become
a
place of
complete separation.
No berths were
placed across any of the partitions—^The
whole centre of the ship was left free, except
a small
store-
;;,-
room, for the convenience of issuing the provisions.
It at once struck me, that these arrangements were excel-
lent, and
such
as
ought
to be adopted on board every ship
carrying emigrants.
April
1 7th, ia34.—The British Tar
sailed from
Spit-
head, with a fine
fair wind from the Eastward,
having on
board
li-J5 emigrants, namely 81
men, 20 women, and 34
children, from
the county of Sussex, and Isle of Wight, for
Upper Canada.

The moniing of the 28th April broiight us an Increase to
our party, Mrs. Ditton having been safely put to bed of a girl.
The
lead
pipe, from
the water
closets, was choaked up
through carelessness
;
the carpenter, in endeavouring to clear
it of a large bone, injured the pipe so much,
as to render
its
removal necessary, and reported that he could not repair
it.
In this dilemma, two young men (Kemps) voluntarily brought
their knowledge and
labour to our aid, and repaired
it in a
substantial manner. The lead which had been used was much
too thin
: and
I mention the circumstance by way of precau-
tion, on any future occasion,
as there
is scarcely a greater
privation on board of an Emigrant ship, than the loss of this
kind of accommodation.
April 29th.—A violent gale, the wind blowing very hard
from
the
west,
from
the
attention
however,
of Captain
Crawford to the ship, and still more, from the qualities of the
ship herself, we rode
safely, and triumphantly, through the
storm
; and the people suffered but
little comparative incon-
venience.
From tills period, the winds continued alternately
adverse, and favouriible.
Finding that all the people, more
especially those affected
by sea sickness. Mere
suftiering much from
thirst and cold,
duri.ng
this tempestuous weather
; and that the
latter, was
increasing
as
v.e
approached Newfoundland, and knowing,
from experience,
tlitit the water on board of a ship,
is, at no
time, a very palatable
beverage,
1 procured
s(>nie peas from
Captain Crawford, and caused to be made for every person a
pint of excellent soup, which was so generally liked, that
I
was induced to continue it, every Tuesday and Saturday, un-
til we reached the river St. Lawrence.
April 30th and May
1st.—A strong gale from the west.
May 4th. (Sunday.)—\Vhether there be any thing clerical
in my manner or appearance,
I cannot pretend to
say, but
certain it is, that this day, Mrs. Ditton's husband came to
me, and gravely rcqtursted to have the child, born on Monday
last, baptized.

rior
quality, and
several of the young men expressed a wish
that the voyage might last for six months.
By a
strict observance
of
the
rules and
regulations,
I
may
say,
comparatively
s[)eaking, that
I
experienced
very
little
trciuble^—with one or two
exceptions, 1 have no com-
plaint to make, and none was made
to me, of any improper
conduct, but such as arose from the thoughtlessness of youths
1 found no
difficulty, in procuring such
services as were
required, without
further extra
allowances, than
a
bottle of
brandy weekly, to Mr. Upton, Gamblin, Green, and Martin—
u bottle of rum weekly to the cook, and the men who assisted
him, for the days
only, on which no grog was
issued
; and
a bottle of rum weekly, which
I
thouglit
it advisable to give
to the
ship's company,
in brder
to promote a good under-
standing, between them, and the people—in the latter object
I fully succeeded
All were comfortable and contented.
We had, during
the voyage, our ahare
of sea sickness ;
but out of the whole party, only two women,
five men, and
two boys,
suffered
severely
;
in these cases a cup of coffee
M'as the most grateful beverage, but as usual, the most certain,
and
effectual
relief, was derived from
lying down
in
their
berths.
We had also, during the voyage, twelve
cases of measles,,
seven of these, had perfectly recovered before our arrival at
Grosse Isle, four
•were at the time
recent, and
mild
cases»
between
the
sixth, and
eight day, of the disease—and one
remained in a state of convalescence, though under consider-
able debility, having embarked
as an
invalid
£i-om a severe
attack of influenza.
All the
people, with the above excep-
tions, were in high health and spirits.
Here we
counteu twenty
eigl't
vessels, at the anchorage.
At
9, A. M. Captain Nicholas, the harbour master, came
along side, and furnished us with a copy of a Proclamation,
of the executive Council of Lower Canada, dated
at Quebec,

At

the

; mus-
tered
the
passen<i^ers, directed
us
to
hoist the yellow Fliuf,
and
to send
the convalescent,
and the four recent cases of
measles, to the
hospital.
We were thus placed
in durance
vile, at a time, when the same disease (the measles) prevailed,
both
at Quebec, and
Montreal,
and
prol)ably, in
half the
Townships of the Lower Province.
From want of room,
however,
in the hospital,
the con-
valescent only, was sent on shore, for the
benefit of
hospital
diet, and
better
nursing
; and the four
recent
cases
left in
my care.
From the mildness of the
disease, the
cleanliness of the
ship, the general
health, and comfortable appearance of the
people
; we hoped, and were led
to
believe, day
after day,
that we should o]>taiu our
liberty—atul
I am
satisfu'd, s«ich
wotdd have been the case, had any discretionary power rested
with
the
authorities
at
Grosse
Isle,
I>ut
unfortunately we
came within the limits of a general enactment.
May
24tli.—The
regidations
required,
that
every
man,
who had chaff or straw, in Ms bed, should throw
it overboard,
although, none M'as allowed to replace it.
This circumstance, may be but
of trifling moment, to the
generality of emigrants, who in 24 hours, reach Quebec, and
there quit
their
ships
;
but not
so
to
our
people, who
were to proceed in a body, and had
still before them, a pas-
sage of ten days, to Toronto (late York)
; some of the women
being at the time, near the period of their confinement.
It is true, that Captain
Read, the Commandant, to whom
I had appealed, on the
subject,
told me, on the day of our
liberation, that he had just received a supply of straw, for the
service of the hospital; and offered nic some, but I preferred
purchasing, at Quebec, or Montreal, to avoid further delay.
Sunday, 25th. May.
Read prayers to the people, and de-
livered a testament and
prayer book,
in their presence, with
admonition and
advice, to Samuel ilichardson
; who, on his
way from Brighton
to
Portsmouth, sold
his
bible, to John
Barton, for eighteen pence.
May 27th.—Received orders to land the people for inspec-
tion, who were obliged
(the wind and tide being unfavour-
able)
to remain on
shore
all
night.

Consequently, Capt;U[l

Captain Read the commandant, had the kuidncss and hos'
pitality to make us both
dine with him, and to send us on
board by his own boat, at (midnight) the time of high water.
May 28th.—At 9 A. M. carried bread and cheese on shore
for the people.
Inmiigated the ship.
At
1
P. ^I. obtiiined permission to re-embark the people.
At 5 P. M., got all the people and their baggage safely on
b:)ard, although William Dighton had a momentary
dip .in
the water, along side the ship.

Brought on

On the 5th May, the first ship of the season had arrived at
Grosse Isle, and by this time, the number amounted to 327,
brintring G4.5 cabin, and
10,919 steerage
passengers
:
in
all
1 1 ,5t)4 Emigrants.
Sunday, June
1st.—At 6 A.M. weighed,
with
a
light
bree/e, from the N. E. a remarkably fine day.
At 11 A. M.
reached the Isle of Orleans, which
is about 20 miles long, 4
miles wide, and
.50
miles
in
circumference;
the river
is 16
miles
wide,
and
fresh
at
lo.v
water, the
scenery
beauti-
ful
;
the people were highly delighted—those who hitherto
hesitated, from the
sterile,
and mountainous appearance of
the land, to give an opinion, now yielded their ready appro-
bation,
saying. "This
will do."
On the upper end of the
Island, the timber ships Columbus, and Baron Renfrew, were
built.
After passing the
Isle of Orleans, to
the
south, the
beautiful falls of Montmorency, on the north side of the river,
open to the view.
At 1 P. M. anchored
at Quebec, which
is situated on the
promontory of Cape Diamond, 320 ftet high, and 360 miles
up the St. Lawrence.
Delayed by the customary visitations, and inspections, of
ILarbour Master, Custom
Ilouse, and Quarantine
Officers:
but more especially, by changing our pilot
; and the new one
refusing to go on, until the following morning.
A fine fresh
breeze from the N. E. with thunder,
lightening, and
rain,
(luring the night.
Here a novel appearance, presents itself,
in the tin covered roofs, of the churches, and public buildings,
which produce a brilliant effect in the sun.

At 10 A. M. the wind cume suddenly
like a torrent from the westward
i we were
in consequenctf
obliged to anchor at Wolf's cove.
At 2 P. M. went on
shore with
Captain
Crawford, and
engaged a steam
boat,
(the
St. George)
to tow us up the
river
: about midnight the boat took us in tow.
June 3rd.—We passed the rapids of llichlieu, in the night,
M'hich was very dark.
At 11 A. M. reached Trolt Riviere, 90 miles from Quebec*
and 90 miles from Montreal.
Here we took in a supply of wood, for fuel. The country is
rich, and Well cultivate(l, on the banks of the river St. Tiaw-
rence;
b\it being generally Hat, the scenery has little variety.
At 6 P. M. passed tlirough the south channel of the Lake St.
Peter:
the entrance is so narrow, that one miglit almost leap
on shore, and
so
concealed,
as to
give no indieation of a
passage, until
it opens suddenly through,
a beautiful, grassy
flat,
or meadow.
In the dusk of
tlie evening, we passed
Sorel, 40 miles from Montreal, by midnight: we had
got
over
the
Rapids, and
difficult part of the passage, up the
river: we were obliged however, to wait, an hour or two, for
the tide, in order to pass some rocky shallows and narrow's.
June 4lh.— At 4 A, M. we
arrived
at
Montreal,
advan-
tageously sittiated for trade, and shipping
:
the town is large
and populous;
the houses good, built of stone;
streets pretty
iregular, and wide: here are fine buildings, partictdarly, a very
handsome Roman Catholic Cathedral, built of red free stone ;
here
is a beautiful
hill of considerable
elevation, in the back
groiuid of the town.
At 9 A. M. called on the Hon. Peter Mc.Gill, from whom,
I received the greatest possible attention, and assistance, and
who gave me some useful information, about the old route by
the St. Lawrence, and the new on^, by the Rideau canal.
Having conducted the people thus
far, in
safety, I cannot
avoid
remarking, how much
they
were
cast
down,
and
annoyed, by having been detained under quarantine, for nine
days, landed, with all their luggage for inspection, at Grosse
Isle, and obliged
to remain on shore there,
all the night;
without any other
shelter, than that of an open shed, witii
barely room sufficient for the women and children.
It is impossible for me to describe, how sorry I was, to sec
ii cleanly, and healthy people, mixed, as they were in the dirt,
and filth, of thousands

Tlip vexation, wliicli
I ex|>erienceil from these clrcuujstan-
ccs, was j^reatly increased, by the
contniuance of a fine fair
wind from the N. E., diiring the whole time of our detention,
which wonhl have carried us to Montreal, hi thirty- six hours!
And further, by the expenoe of £6

daily incurrinjif—aniountint^ for nine days t«> iJOO

Mortified, liowever, as
I was, by these occurrences;
I soon
found myself placed,
uniler circumstances,
still more vexa-
tious
; by the sudden changing of wind, from fair, to foul, at
Quebec
: here
1 was under the necessity of engaging a steam
boat to tow the ship to Montreal
;
on arriving at which city,
a charge of £2\
: 7
'•^h
'^^^ half- passage money, fr')m Quebec,
in addition to £53
: 7
: 1^ for towage, was preferred
against
me, which, notwithstanding svery remonstrance, I was obli-
ged to pay.
Thus, by this detention, have the Committee been exposed,
imnecessarilv, (tho' unavoidably on my part)
to an expenoe
of X'i;i5 :!.'>: 4.
I'his circumstance, has l>een to me, a subject of continued
regret, and
to
the Committee one of peculiar hardship, as
they spare neither toil, care, nor expence,
in
funiishing the
Enngrants,
sent out under their management, with the moNt
ample allowance of provisions,
water,
and
every
comfort,
which a ship can alTord
; both
in regard to accommodation,
O-nd saii'ty.
Not u\any medical men, of the present day, would place a
ship under quarantine, on account of a few cases of measles^
more especially, at a time, when the disesise prevailed in the
country
;
at
Quebec, and Montreal, and probably
in every
town of Lower Canada.
The cases of measles,
on hoard
the
British Tar, were of

description; therefore
I say, as a professional man,
that the detention at Grosse
Isle, and consequent expence,
were unnecessary; the more
so, as those cases, were placetl
under
such
arrangements,
as would have prevented,
their
mixing,
with
strangers,
before
their
arrival
at
Toronto; a
journey of ten days.
I do not blame
the authorities of Grosse Isle,
for any of
these occurrences
:
I am
satisfied, that the accommodation,
aiul assistance,
at that place,
is not adequate,
to the duties
of the station j and
I
believe,
they have
little, or no
discre-
tionary power.
The principal place, where persons in quar-
antine,
at Grosse
Isle,
are
sent
to wash, and
clean
their
clothes, and themselves,
is a continued succession, of small.

until the winds
scatter

abroad, over the clean, and the unclean; instead of the ground
being levelled, and the
filth, swept into the
River
St. Law-
rence.
Were the ground,
properly
levelled,
the prevailing
winds, would
nearly perform the work
of sweeping.
The
inspection of Enii:^rant8, and
their
lugju[age, might be per-
formed,
in
a
manner
equally
efficacious,
on
board
their
ships; by which mode, those who have aii\ elothos, to inspect,
would be saved, from much uiniccessary trouble, and annoy-
ance, and at the same time, thereby a^'oiH, the risk ol' loss of
property and
life.
Engaged of Mr. Gushing, a new boat, to carry us to King-
ston, at 12«. (id. per passage, including one cwt. of baggage,
for each
full passage
; and
eight cwt.
of provisions.
This
vessel was dift'erent from the Durham boats, used on former
occasions ;
of which there has been so miicli coujplaint
: she
was entirely decked over, hud a good connuodious cabin, witfi
fixed bed places, in which were accommodated
tlic principal
l)art of the women, girls, and children.
The access
to the cabin, was by a good
stair, or what is
called, a companion ladder.
Tlie vessel, had a main hatch-
way, near which, the remainder of the females, and children,
M'ere
placed, next to the cabin
; and
a
fore-hatchway, by
which the young, and single men, entered to their berths.
This
part of the boat, was not partitioned
off, from that
down the main hatchway; but the whole of the married men,
were placed between the
single ones, and the females.
By
tliis arrangement, the whole party had ample room for sleep-
ing, in the night, and protection, and shelter, either from bad
weather, or heat of the sun, by day, and felt perfectly comfor-
table; behig,a8 nearly as possible, in the same relative position,
which they had been accustomed to in the British Tar, and
from which they might easily fancy themselves not yet removedt
In this manner,
the people proceeded, from Montreal to
Kingston, without being once removed from the boat, and I
immediately found a conveyance
for the whole party, (125)
on board the Cobourg steamer, to Toronto.
As steam boats letive Kingston daily, for Toronto, there
is
no probability of even a large party, being detained for more
than 24 hours
; and Emigrants proceeding by the
St. Law-
rence, are liable to the like detention at Prescott.

We were prevented landing the remainder of the provi-
sions, in tinu* for tlie custom house hours, by the absence of
the seamen of the British Tar:
but Captain Crawford enga.

to deposit them, with the Hon. Peter Me. Gill, the fol-
lowing day.
Sealed, and delivered the medicine chest, into the hands of
Captain Crawford, for conveyance to Kngland.
Mr. and Mrs. Huntley, and Mr. and Mrs. Bassum, and

June Gth.—At 7 A. M. t]\v boat, with
the people,
set out
for Lacliine,
1 remuiiied myself at Montreal, for a few hours
to
settle
accounts, w ith the Hon.
Peter Mc.Gill, and Mr.
Cushing, whom
I would
strongly recommend,
to
persons
passing on to the Upper Province,
for
his attenuon
to the
busuiess of his otHce, readiness to give information, respecting
the mode of proceeding, and his remarkable
civility, and pa-
tience, towards thoMc who apply to him.
At 11 A.M.I left Montreal, by coach, and had the good
fortune, to find, amongst my fellow travellers, on the outside,
Mr. Gunn,
i\ gentleman
in the Commissariat Department,
proceeding also to Lachine, in charge of two government bat-
teaux; having stores for Kingston, accompanied by his friend,
Mr. Hodges, Adjutant of the 24th Kegt. on a pleasure excur-
sion.
At noon, reached Lachine, a distance of eight miles; where
I found our
boat
;
here we were detained five hours, in con-
sequence of the steam boat, having got aground up the river.
While waiting for her arrival, Mr. Gunn, and Mr. Hodges,
took a row boat, and crossed the
river, to view a large
vil-
lage, of native blacks
; and were anxious,
to persuade me, to
accompany them ;
I declined with reluctance, not thinking it
prudent, to leave the people, and it was well
I did, from what
occurred with

behind him, seven chihlren, under twelre years, and his wife,
very near the time of her confinement,
with
the
eightii.
I
immediately set out mvself,
in pursuit of him, accompanied
by six men
:
alter a diligent search,
he was fortunately dis-
J
covered, in some bushes, a mode, of concealment, probably
*
not new to him, being an old smuggler.
This happened, just at the
riglit moment,
as
the stfam
boat, that was to tow us. hud arrived
in the mean time, and
the master was impatient to set off.
We started at five, in a remarkably fine evening; and were
at once delighted, and astonished,
at the magnificence, and
grandeur, of the scenery, as we ascended the river Ottawa.
Just before dark, we arrived at the mouth, of a short canal,
in the seignory of Vaudreuil ; 30 miles from Laehine.
This canal, has been
cut through a
reef of rocks, which
extends across the river, by the company of forwarders
; and
it has one lock
:
in the stream,
there
is not more than two,
or three, feet water.
As we approached,
several small boats, or
canoes, were
fishing, and others preparing to fish, with harpoons.
We entered the lock, just at the close of day, and saw some
young men, wading,
in
the stream, and
spearing plenty of
iish, by the light of their torches, which
powerfully, and
agreeably, called to mind, the scenes of my youth, in the Et-
terick, the Yarrow, and the Tweed.
We experienced considerable delay, in getting through the
lock, first with the steam boat, then our boat, and next the
two government batteaux.
This seignory had descended
to
two heiresses, Mr. Bingham,
(an American) married one of
them ; and Mr. Ilarwood, of Sheffield, the other.
Here is a
mill belonging to the latter.
The navigation, both before we reached, and after we left
Vaudreuil, is very intricate, and
difficult,
in the night time;
but from the experience of the boatmen, we got on without
interruption.
June 7th.—At / A, M. we arrived at
Carrillon, 30 miles
from Vaudreuil: from this place, passengers proceed by coach,
to Grenville.
Mr. and Mrs. Pluntley, who had
rejoined
at
Laehine, went on by this conveyance, as did also (Mr. Gunn's
friend) Mr. Hodges
; with
a
request to the Captain, of the
eteam boat, at Grenville, from Mr. Gunn, to wait for him.
At Ca-'illon, we entered a canal of two miles,
in
length j

with tluTc loc'k.s upon

readiness, the
people willingly performed the work, and in a short period of
til
tve again entered the river.
Mere, after the delay of nn
hour, another steam boat took
us in tow,
for three miles, when we again entered a short
canal, cut through the solid rock
;
with one lock,
in order
to pass the rapids of Chute an Blondeau,
llcre the
river is divided
into two streams, by a mass of
high rocks, sixty, or eighty yards
long, which
has
the pp-
pc rance, of having been
torn
off, from the main
land, by
toonic convulsion of nature.
The current
is here
so
strong,
that the steam
boat,
M-as
compelled
to keep
close
under the
high
land of the main
stream; where the water is very deep, and comjiaratively still.
'I'he steam boats, in
returning, do
not
pass through
the
lock, but go down the principul stream, which carries *hem
along \^'ith great rapidity.
Having ascended the
river, for two miles from Chute au
Blondeau
; we arri\ ed at the entrance of the Grenville canal,
which is cut through a I'.ori/ontal stratum of schistus rock, for
:i distance of seven miles:
it has seven locks. We « ere towed
through the canal by horses.
As we approached
(ircnville, Mr.
Hodges met
us,
ami
said, that the steam boat, hml left that place, (the passengers
for the previous day, who had already been detained twenty,
four hours, refusing to wait any
longer)
but
that, the Cap-
tain had promised, he would return for us, the next day.
At
noon, we reached
(ircnville
:
no accommodation
for
strangers in the village.
Mr. Hodges, fortunately for us all,
had an acquaintance
here,
on whom he called, a Mr. Eddy,
Paymaster of the Ordnance Department,
in charge
of the
canal, and of the people employed on
it.
Mr. Eddy, came down to the canal, and asked Mr. Gvnn to
dinner
;
an liour afterwards, Mr. Eddy, accompanied by Mr.
Hodges, came down to the water side, where they found me
preparing to take a dip,
in the cool, limpid, stream
;
he
in-
sisted also on my joining them, at dinger; which WviS waiting.
—I did so.
After enjoying a very good meal, Mr. Gnnn's men, man-
ned Mr. Eddy's boat, and we made an excursion, with the
family, across a large bay, formed by a sudden turn, and ex-
pansion of the
river,
to view the Falls of Chalumet, which
arc formed by a siuall stream of water, dashing over a prcci-

Returned to spend the evening, and
to the enjoyment of
e.vcellent beds
: gave Mrs. Eddy six testaments to distribute.
Sunday, June 8th. rose early, and
visited
the people, and
gave them permission to attend church: returned to breakfast,
with Mr. Eddy's family
: we were
all preparing
for church,
when the steam boat came in sight, and
in an instant, were
on the move
; by noon,
jdl were embarked, the boat,
in tow
of the steamer, and we on our wav.
At 2 P. M. passed on our left La

of Sir C. Grant, in thn township of IlawKesbury.
At
T) P. M. passed a pretty island, with a good neat house,
on a small
hill, in v.'hich a man, of the name of Winsor (one
of the mutineers of the Nore)
resides.
June 9th, at 5 A. M. we reached Bytown, about (50 miles
froni Cirenville.
Accompanied Mr. Hodges, to visit the ChaV'.
diere Falls, or grand rapids of the Ottawa, which are situated,
about a mile out of our course, higher up the
river. There is
here, a connnunication, with Hull, on the opposite side, by a
succession of l)ridges, thrown across the rapids
: elevated por-
tions of rock,
resembling an
artificial embankment, running
across
a
dry
ravine, and affording an easy access,
to
these
bridges
:
here many
lives
have
been
lost,
many
rafts
of timber have been wrecked
in
these
rapids
; numbers
of
fine spars, and logs lay,
rotting, entirely out of the reach of
man;
in the deep holes, and crevices,
of the rocks, worn by
the continued fall of the water,
in
its mighty, and impetuous
course—the scene is wild, and granil.
Retvirned
to Hytown,
to
breakfast on board
the
steam
boat Toronto.
Here, we quitted the Ottawa, and entered the
Hide.'iu canal,
by
a
successicm
of eight locks,
of excellent
workmanship,
and
durable
materials
;
affording
a
rise
of
eighty-one feet
: we were detained an
hour, by two steam
boats, in vain
attemptin«r to
pass
each other
in the upper
basin of the canal.
Surely the possibility of passitig
should
be reduced to a certainty, and not left for idle experiment.
At Ilogsback: four miles from Bytown, there are two locks,
with a rise of thirteen and a half feet
: the canal here,
is nar-
row, and passes, a part of the way, through a natural hollow,
j^t Black rapids, fcmr
miles from Hogsback, there are two
I :<;ks, with a rise of tifteen feet.
At Long Island rapids, eight miles from Black rapids, and

with a rise of only two feet
:
land good.
Ednumd's Falls
;
three
miles from
Miiitland's Falls, one

Sly's
Falls
;
fimr
miles, from Edmund's
Falls ; two
locks, with a rise of fifteen feet:
here you enter the canal, or
luck, at a right angle, the passage
is narrow, and much
in-
commoded, by about twenty stumps of
trees, on the project-
ing angle; which might easily be removed, and the entrance
widened, by one half:
here is plenty of freestone.
Smith's Falls
; two and a half miles from Old Sly's Falls
;
three locks, with a
rise
of thirty-four
feet
:
here
is a small
village, rapidly increasing, from the facility of erecting water
mills, of which there are already
several,
in operation,
its
chief reconmiendation
:
here is a rocky island of hard lime-
stone, approaching to marble
:
the
country
is swampy, and
a
chain, of beaver
meadows,
runs
a
distance
of
several
miles, back towards Merricksville.
At First rapids, three miles from Smith's Falls, and eight
from Oliver's Ferry, there
is one lock

;
eight miles from Perth, and thirty-five miles, from
Brockville
:
the public road passes the Rideau Lake at this
place, which is 460 feet wide, and 35 feet deep.
At 8 P. M. passed the Isthmus, about one mile in length,
four and a half miles from the Narrows
; one lock, with a fall
of three feet : the night being very dark, the boat got aground
:.nd we were obliged, nothiiig loath,
to wait till tlie morning.
Called up in the night to Mrs. West, who had threatening
»ymptoms of labour, but which passed aivay.
June 12th.—The steam boat, being unable to make head-
way against the Mind, let go her anchor, to avoid drifting, on
the rocky
shore
; and we
did
the same
:
soon
afterwards,
having cast off the battcaux, she proceeded with our boat only,
as far as the nearest headland, and leaving us there, returned
for the others.
We then, all got on together, Avithout further difficulty, to
Chaffey's
Mills;
four and a half miles from
the Isthmus;
one lock, with a
fall of fourteen
feet
:
here
is abundance of

:
plenty of freestone, and limestone of the granite-
like ajjpearance.
In approaching Brewer's Mills
; we passed through a large
lake (Cranherry) full of sedgy, floating, islands; havhig the ap-
pearance, of a meadow, overflowed with water, and the passage
very intricate.
Brewer's Upper Mills;
twelve miles from Jones's Falls;
two locks, M'ith a fall of eighteen feet.

enonj^h for the steam boat to pass.
Kingston
Mills, ten
miles from Brewer's Lower
Mills }
four locks, with a full of 49fe?t; stopped for the fourth night:
situation low and marshy.
June 13th, at 8 A. M. arrived at Kingston,
six miles fromi
Kingston Mills
; having, notwithstanding the
accidental de-
lays, above described, arising from varions causes
j and in no
slight degree, from the impediments, presented by
stumps,
and floating trees, M'hich I trust, will not long be suffered to
remain, accomplished the paassige, from Montreal to King-
stonv in seven days.
All the
people arrived there
in perfect health, for altho'
from the dismal stories, spread ahroad of the extreme danger,
to which they would be exposed, of contracting fever, and
ague, in the swamps of the Kidcau,
I
had provided
myself,
with an ample supply
of quinine,
not one
case occurred,
among them,
which
required
a single dose, of this, or any
other medicine, since we left Montreal.
1 will subjoin an extract from the journal of a respectable
man,
William
Phillips,
of Merston,
near
Chichester, who
Aveiit out with his wife and child in 18J^, at his own expence,
to join
his
son,
already
settled
in Adelaide,
describing
his
route up the St. Lawrence
; and then leave the reader to form
his own judgment
sis to which of the two is the best.
" In
the morning, we with our luggage, went on board
two large Durham boats, and was carried through the locksi
in
the Lachinc
canal,
there we were forced to
unload the
boats, to have every thing weighed;
it was six in the evening,
before we
left
this
place, and got to Lachine
at eleven
at
night
; could go no farther,
for the lock
: we expect'*<l
s(une
phice to go to, but no place was provided for us ; go we sat in
the boat all night
:
in
the morning the men went, and stole
wood, and made a great fire.
The next day, being Sunday,
V
st;iy all day and night, we made tents, and
slept on the
ground.
Monday morning, at break of day,
sailed
the re-
mainder of the canal, and crossed a small
lake, into another
canal, called the cascades
;
with
a
great many
locks, every
one taking lus several feet higher up a hill.
This canal, is cut
through a rock,
to miss the rapids in this
place
: we were
now drawn by oxen, up the
rapi<ls, they walked at the edge
of tlic water, taking us as near the outside of the water, as
the boats could go
: our travelling this way is very tiresome^

and took us eight days, to get to Prescot ; the iirst night we
reached a village, and after begging hard, we prevailed with
them to let us lay on their floor
: we
carried our beds, and
slept there, at the charge of
6rf. each
:
at break of day, we
went on board, and stopped at
night, where
there was no
houses
: we borrowed the sail, and as many as could get un-
der did
:
the others, made a large fire, and sat, or slept by it;
the next day, it rained all day, and at night we stopped at a
village, and prevailed with some poor people,
to lodge us, a
house full, on their floor
; they
let
us make
tea, and dryed
our clothes
: in the night,
I was taken
ill, with the spasms,
and a fever followed ;
I
did not
eat one mouthful, of food,
for eight days ; oidy drinked a little port wine often.
I could
not hardly get in, or out uf the boat, nor did I think I sliould
ever see Adelaide. We at last came to Prescot
;
sleeping on
the ground every
nighty
but
two:
the
boatmen
were
all
Frenchmen, and no way obliging ; we could not make the
kettle boil, by the
fire. When we came to Prescot, we were
all very wet with rain, and went to a tavern, hoping to dry
ourselves
;
but we were so many, standing in their way, they
did not want us there, so we « as forced to remain, as we was.
At five o'clock, we went on board the steamer, to Cornwall,
in a close room; should have been comfortable, if we had been
dry. We got to Cornwall, about five in the morning; the boat-
men said, we m\ist walk uine miles, the rapids run so strong
:
a great many ivalked
; but myself, so
ill,
I could not; so my-
self, and Ellen, and three more women, with small children,
hired a waggon, and two horses, to carry us twelve
miles,
for two dollars
:
these waggons are not like youi's, they have
one straight board, on each side, one at the head, and one be-
hind, just like a great chest, without a lid
; they
tu*e like this
all the country through
; butwc had spring seats, and a man
to drive
:
the
boats did
not
get
he.
"ntil the afternoon
:
the roads are very dirty, and rough
; but
this
is one of
tlic
best, being where the crachcs run.
Tlje men walked on,
but
the women and children got in the boats, for we were as much
in the rapids, as before
;
the middle of the stream,
is worse,
by far, than the edge of the water; where
vre were drawn by
oxen, when we got at last tt) Prescot, we took the stranicr for
York, across Lake Ontario.
1 have told you wrong; we
came to
Cornwall,
before we came to Prescot
;
the
other
place's name,
1
have forgot
:
Prescot is where w.
took the
steamer, for York."

^
Mr. Gunn, who was in charge of the government batteaux
left us here.
I cannot allow this gentleman to depart, with-
out expressing my sense of oullgation, for the very great ser-
vices, he rendered us, during
tlie whole
route
;
especially in
getting through the locks, which,
ly his asisistan<'e and iiiflu
ence, was accomplished much (piicker, than would otherwise
have been the case.
Kingston is a thriving town, with abundance of fine stone
for building, or pavement, in the vicinity
:
here
in
a wooden
bridge, of many arches (under one of which we passed) com-
municating with the dock
j'ard opposite
; which
is strongly
fortified.
From Montreal to this place, by the St. Lawrence,
is HX) miles, and by the Ridcau, 240.
The people not having been
able to
procure any milk or
beer, since we passed Merricksville,
I gave on our arrival at
Kingston, a pint of beer to every man and woman
;
andhalf
a pint of milk to each of the children, as a treat, which cost
22s. Gtl.
At 10 A. M. agreed with the captain of the Cobourg steam
boat, to carry us on
t(> Toronto,
at
iys. (id. per passage,
in-
cluding all luggage.
About 20 women, and sonie of the youngest of the children,
M'cre accommodated with beds in the fore i';d)in.
June 14th, at 4 A. M. the steam boat touched at Cobourg.
I came on deck here, to take a view
of the place, which
is
certainly
very
pretty.
The scenery on the banks of Lake Ontario was
fine, and
the expanse of water magnificent.
At 3 P. M. we arrived at Toronto, 1/0 miles from Kings-
ton, all in high health and spirits, not the slightest indisposi-
tion felt by any of the people.
I waited immediately on A. B. Ilawke,
Es(|. the govern-
ment agent for Emigrants, who accompanied me
to the go-
vernor's house, where
I M-as gniciously-Teceived, delivered my
credentials, and was directed by his excellency. Sir John Col-
borne, to allow as many of the people
as could
find employ-
ment for themselves, to do so.
An open shed on the beach,
or
bay, was
allotted
for the
people generally
: a small house, at a considerable distance, with
two or three rooms, was provided for one or two families, West's
particularly, whose wife expected daily her confinement.
All however declined the accommodation provided for them,
and found lodgin^^s for themselves
:
the heavy luggage,
1 de.^
posited in a store on the wharf.

It would certainly
have been
of advantage to the people
themselves, and
convenient to me, under the circumstances,
to have had them altogether, within my grasp
:
but
I nmst
admit, that the kind of accommodation
offered, was calcu-
lated only, for the most
destitute description of Emigrants,
and but
ill suited to our people, (who were rather of a better
class) at the termination of a voyage
;
I could
therefore nei-
ther be surprised, nor find fault with them, for rejecting
it.
At 8 P. M.,
I found shelter for myself in the Ontario housu,
where I was comfortably lodged; lived at a kind of table (I'liote
of fifty or
sixty persons
; and was much anuised to witness
the rapidity with which the gentlemen assembled, at the ring-
ing of a bell, and the despatch they made in eating, or ratlier
devouring their meals, as if engaged in a match against time,
or impelled by the most ravenous hunger.
In a cpuirter of
an hour, nearly all had swallowed tlieirfood and disappeared,
except some few stragglers, who had come in
late, and with
whom I commonly finished my meal in quiet.
June 15th.
I considered that on arriving
at Toronto, my
expenditure for the people should cease
;
but, as
it was Sun-
day, and they could not receive their money, payable at
tlie
oflice of the Canada company, and many were consecpienily
without
food,
I
procured,
after nmeh
search and troubs',
enough bread and cheese and beer, to supply all, who applied
to me,
namely,
fifty-eight
persons with
bread and cheese,
and forty-one persons with beer.
June 16th.
Signed the peoples' drafts
for their money on
the Canada company, which they aii received, and were per-
fectly contented.
I called on Mr. Jones, of the Canada company, and found
a letter from the Rev. T. Sockett. A most agreeable and de-
lightful circumstance, to
receive
intelligence of friends
at a
ilistance
!
This letter also contained the following
ADDITIONAL
IXSTRUCTIOXS.
To spare no pains or expence to become master of the sub-
ject, which is the preferable
route,
the Rideau or
St. Law-
rence
; what acconunodation of waggons;
shelter of boats,
8ic.
for women and
children
?
If the route
by Quebec
is
considered a bad one, and that by New York, Albany, and
Oswego,
is likely to be performed with
less discomfort,
you
will make
every
practicable
encjuiry,
as
to any system of
pgency,
established at New York, and through
the
States,

f
^
S4
to ensure any Emigrants from being enticed away from their
ultimate destination, by delusive representations.
Return by New York, and communicate with our English
Emigration
agents,
at every station, explaining your com-
mission from us, and reason for so doing.
Some plan might
possibly be hit upon for parties to be met at Toronto
; Hamil-
ton
; Fort George
; Niagara ; or the Welland canal
: we shall
not complain of any expence which tends to the main object
;
relief on this eide
; and improvement on that.
I am above all things anxious that you should return fully
informed upon every point
; and furnished with every book
;
map ; plan
; every document, of every
kind, that for love or
money, you can lay your hand upon.
Let no fear of a little extra expence restrain you from push-
ing your enquiries to the utmost.

Received
a note from A. B. Hawke, Esq. intimating the
Lt.
Governor's
intention
to send
the
people toBlandford
;
and
requesting
to
see me the
following morning
on
the
subject.
June 17th. accompanied by Mr. Hawke,
1 waited on the
Governor, who received me in the most affable manner.
His
Excellency directed,
that all the
families should proceed to
Blandford
; where
he was certain they would
find employ-
ment: that each family should receive a five-acre lot of cleared
land, in the township, on which a log hut should be erected
;
that they should hold the above, for a few years, or until they
could do better for themselves.
That such of the young men
as
I thought
fit, and were
willing, should go to the canal forming on the Grand River,
or to the harbour at Kettle Creek, where they would
find
employment,
at from £2
to £3 per month
: and that the
others should accompany the families
to Blandford, where
several gentlemen had
lately made purchases of lands ; and
where labourers were much required.
Shut up in the Ontario house for the remainder of the day,
by a torrent of rain.
Paid Mr. Upton the steward; the cook, and other persons,
who had been useful in various capacities, during the voyage,
for their respective services.
June 18th. engaged at Mr. Ilawke's office until four in the
afternoon, in binding some boys as apprentices ;

arrangements to carry the directions and wishes of the Go-
vernor into execution
; and in preparing a list of the families,
and young men, for Blandford, and also of those for the canal.
Received from Mr. Hawke a letter of introduction, and in-
structions, to Mr. Cattennole, at Hamilton, to provide accom-
modation and waggons;
also
letters to Captain Drew and
Mr.
Hatch,
resident
magistrates
at
Blandford,
to provide
accommodation ; and to give every assiijtance in their power
to the people.
Received from the Hon. Peter Robinson, government land-
agent at Toronto, a letter of introduction to Colonel Talbot,
and some
to
the land-agents
in
different parts of the pro-
vince,
requesting them
to
furnish me,
as
the superinten-
dent of the Egremont Emigrants of this season, with every
information in their power, respecting the
state of the pro-
vince generally.
Mr. Hawke told me that the Governor would pay the pas-
sages of the young men by the schooner Superior, for Kettle
Creek, which would land them
at Port Robinson, in Lake
Erie
;
that he would also pay for the passage of the people
for Blandford, in the steam boat to Hamilton
; and for the
conveyance of their baggage, by waggons to Blandford ; and
for bread and cheese, and
beer, and accommodation on the
road.
Mr. Hawke also told me, that the governor had done this
from a conviction, that the government ought to do something
for the people sent out by a nobleman, whose
liberality and
humane feelings induced him
to contribute so much, to the
relief of the suffering poor, and to confer so great a service
on these provinces.
I was requested by Mr. Hawke to take charge of a man of
the name of Rivers,
with
his
wife and six children, under
nine years of age, who had arrived at Toronto at this time, by
way of New York
; and who had expended his last shilling.
The Governor had consented to give to this family, the same
advantages ac Blandford, as to our people.
This man com-
plained much of the impositions to which he had been sub-
jected,
in
passing through
the
states, from New York, to
Lake
Ontario,
and
Toronto: he
had, he said, been
even
charged for a little boiling water, to make his tea.
June 19, at 8 A. M. The whole party, consisting of seventy
men, women, and children, composing the families
; one fa«
milyof eight, (Rivers 's
before mentioned,) and twenty younj(
men, in all one hundred persons, including myself, and Dii-
*Q

26
toil's
bahy,
born
at
sra, wore oinharkcd
in the Queenston
Ktoaiii boat, and proceeded for Hamilton.
At 3 P. M.
Ave arrived at the head of the Lake Ontario,
nboiit one
mile from Hamilton
:
here
I
found Mr. Catter-
nu)le,
on
the
wharf, where
the
people and baj^gage, were
landed.
Kxpcrienced much delay and
diftieulty,
in proeuring
conveyance, from
the circuiustanee of twenty-one
wjiggons
having left this place,
the
previous day
for Blandford, with
the family, luggage, Sic. of Admiral Vansittart, who had just
arrived, a^d was proceeding to settle in that township.
A suthcient munber of waggons was at
last
obtained,
the
b;iggage loaded, and by eight in the evening, we reaeheu the
house of Mr. Cattermole, where all the people were supplied
with bread, cheese, and beer
: several of the women obtained
beds
in
the
house, and
the
rvMuainder, men, women, and
cliildren, were lodged
in
a burn for the night, with
plenty
of clean straw and hay.
The two Ilanunoiuls, from Hellingley, found employment
at Oakville, on
the Lake Ontario,
and engaged themselves,
the one at 50s. and the other at 40s. per month, with board
aiul lodging.
George Morgan found employment at Hamil-
ton, and left us
:
the
three
Uptons
also engaged themselves
there
;
but the eldest, Frederick,
volunteered his services, to
inssist me
in conducting
the
people
to
Blandford, which
I
readily accepted.
Jmu' 20th.
!it 10 A. M
left Hamilton
:
proceeded onwards
with the ])arty, having
fojjrteen waggons,
four of them car-
rying the women and children, and ten carrying the baggage.
The first waggon,
h;i<l
the
families
of Barton, Oamblin,
Kemp, and
Martin,
thirteen
in number
:
the second, those
of l^erring and West, twelve in munber
:
the third, those of
Coleman, Ditton, and (ireen, twelve in number:
the
fourth,
those of
Hivers,
Snelling, and Voice,
thirteen
in number
:
and the remaining ten waggons, had
the luggage
only.
In
ascending to the top of the hill behind Hamilton, a distance.of
about one
mile,
the
latter
part
of which
is very steep, the
))rospect
is remarkably
fine ; and
at the top, you
enter
at
once, upon a table land of good clay soil, suitable for wheat,
which
extends as
far
as
Ancaster.
The
soil
is of a light
sandy loam, for the next five miles,
whete you find again,
a
good clay, which continues to Fair Child's Creek, a distance
of about eight miles
: from this place, a sandy loam extends
to Brandtlord, a distance of about five miles. About half way

cheese, and

or Hpirlt«,
for the whole
party, and went
on. As we approached the latter place,
the
road leads along
the edge of a high table land, on the left or cast bank, of the
Grand River, which opens suddenly, and most delightfully to
the view, 300 or 400
feet innncdiutely below you, skirting a
large tract of low land, considerably cleared on its right or west
bank.
The waggon with Coleman's, Ditton's, and Green's
families, and about hjdf of those with luggage, being,
either
more heavily
laden, or the horses not so good jw the others,
had fallen far behind;
but,
jis Mr.
Upton was with them, I
was under no uneasiness
:
and as there was not a very good
prospect of obtaining
comfortiible accommodation,
for
the
whole party
; and as the drivers
witii me, were very anxious
to proceed some miles further,
I procured, a supply of bread,
cheese, and beer, and we went on.
Crossed
the Graml River, by a good wooden
bridge,
to
which, there
is a short, but very steep, descent.
After passing the
flat
laiul W.
of the
river, we came to
some,
of an
inferior
(juality,
thinly covered with oak trees,
and
rising gradually for five miles, at the end of which, at 8
P. M. we arrived at Vanorman's lim, where we
stopped for
the night.
I procured bread and milk, for the children
;
tea and beds
for the women
;
and a
barn, with plenty of straw,
for the
• men and boys
;
at a price agreed on with
llie Landlord.
The
landhuiy
(an American) as
soon as the boys had re-
tired
to
rest,
in the barn, carried out eight or ten counter-
panes and
covered them,
as they lay on the straw, in order
to
charge
us, so many
additional
beds
;
but,
a;>
this was
objected
to, and
she
found, on a refereiu'e to her husband,
the
device would not
answer,
slie
inunediately
carried
off
the counterpanes.
June 21st. West's wife being taken in labour in the night,
I was obliged to
leave
her
her.s with a daughter of Voice's,
as her nurse, and
\^•e
started
at an early hour,
in
order that
the
house
might
be
(juiet,
and
proper
accoiumodations
afforded to
the
VA'onian
:
but not
before
I
had
ascertained
that
all was
right
:
that
a
midwife was
at hand
: and a
medical gentleman near.
In paying the
bill,
I found that the landlady had
doubled
the usual charge for milk, which
I should have resisted, had
I not been
apprehensive,
that
Mrs. West might
fare
the
worse, by the laiullady suffering a secoiul defeat at my hand.
At (i A. M.
Crossed a considerable stream of water

CroHHcd a

At 8 A. M.
About
ten
miles
from
VaiKirnmn'a, and the
same distance from
BlandfonI,
stoppfMl
witii
tlie people to
breakfast, and found very comfortal)le acconunodation, good
treatment, and moderate charj^es
:
here we crossed a stream,
called
Horner's
Creek, which
runs
into
tlio
(Jrand
River.
From Vunorman's
to this place, the land
is of middlinfj (jua-
lity, of a sandy clay
loam, with bhick mould, as
far as Hor-
ner's Creek, a
distance of ten
miles.
Froin
thence, passing
between Blenheim and Burford, the
soil
is sandy, and very
poor. As you approach Biandford, the soil
is of a good black
mould
:
very good land
is found in this township.
At 11 A. M. We
arrived
at Blandford.
I
delivered my
letter to Captain Drew, whom
I found on his way to
attend
a Justice Court.
I then called on Mr. Hatch, wiio gave the
use of his barn, to such of the party as had arrived, and pro-
cured
another,
frouj
a
neighbour,
for
those who
were
following.
The
waggons, with the
second
party, came
dropping in,
during the alternonii, and by
V: M. had
all arrivfd, except
one, which hud been delayed, bv one of the horses fulling
ill.
Sunday, June 22nd.
The
remaining wiiggon came
in
early this morning.
Several
applications were
mn<le
to me,
yesterday, for mechanics and
lal)ourer8, and many euijuiries
this
day,
particularly,
for female
servants and
Utile
t/hia,
gome of wiiom were actually erigaged.
June 23rd.
The object of n>y journey being happily ac-
complished,
I
quitte<l
Blandford, under
the
full conviction,
from the mnnemus
entjuiries made of
myself, and the assu-
rances of Mr. Hatch
(with whom
I
leit a list, and descrip-
tion of the people)
th;.t, in two or
three days, all would
find
employnient in tlic :u'iji,hbourh()()(l.
'I'here was
but one exception
to
this, in the
Ctise of Mr.
Barton, M'ho in leaving Toronto, had cakuluied on ohtaining
the situation of organist to a very pretty church, just finished
bere.
This
church,
a
substantial
brick building, was to be
opened in two or
three weeks, hut, there were not means at
present to
provide
an organ
: Mr.
liarlon's prospects were
consequently, rather dismal.
All the others were contented,
and happy.
Mr. Upton and
myself, retraced
our
steps
to
Hamillon
by a waggon
belonging
to
a man of tlie name of Hamilton

At 8 P. M.
We reached Ancastcr, where
it was recpjisite
to rest for tiie night.
June 24th.
We
arrived at Hamilton, to breakfast, where
Mr. Upton
left me.
I found Mr. and Mrs. Huntley at this
place, about to set out
for
Guelph,
by
a
wjiggon,
with
all
their luggage.
After arranging some
accounts
for the people, with Mr.
Cattermole,
I
also proceeded for
Guelph, but by a different
road: Mr.
Huntley's waggon being heavily laden, his driver
determined
on
taking
tiie
best,
though longest
route, and
the driver of mine, having only my luggage, which was light,
determined to tal;e
the
siiorter
road, by fifteen miles, althu'
very bad, after the Hrst seven or eight.
At

left Hamilton,
passed through
Dundas,
a
flourishing town, situated at the head of Lake Ontario, about
seven
miles
from
Hamilton,
in
the
hollov/,
between two
mountainous
ranges
of
limestone,
through
which
a
fine
stream of water
rims.
'I'he
ascent from Dundas to the top
of the
hill,
is
very steep, but the road
is good
:
the scenery
is romantic
: prospect extensive, and beautiful.
We
soon
entered
a
very
bad
rough and
stony
road,
through
West
Flumbro,
passing
along
the
top
of
rocky
ritlges, with deep ravines below them, lor some miles.
Here we found a horizontal stratum of liniestone, rising in
many places, to the very surface,
with
little
or no
soil, yet
heavily
timbered.
The
road
sonietimes
stony and rough,
sometimes through swamps, and many a long line of cordu-
roy, among stumps, and
holes, innumerable.
The hemlock
pine
prevails, and
is
of great size.
I
observed
frerpiently,
from one
root, a short trunk of about six
feet, dividing into
four trunks of two feet diameter, each rising
to
the
height,
I
shoidd
suppose,
of ninety feet, without a branch
;
others
dividing
into
six trunks,
from
eighteen
inches, to two feet
diameter,
and
rising,
in
the whole height,
to from
130 to
150 feet.
At 7 P. M. Having passed over ten miles of the worst road
I ever travelled, we
stop[/ed for the night at a house kept by
a
person
of the name of
Patterson,
about seventeen miles
from Guelph, where we found plenty to eat, but poor accom-
modation in other respects.
June 25th. At 5 A. M
Proceeded forward
: the road very
bad, for the lirst six miles.

and more cleared.

whieli we reached about

M. to breiikfast.
We approached this phice by a considera-
ble descent, and over a bridge across the Speed, which is
in
a very dangerous state.
Guelph
is very prettily situated, and
has
three
chiu'ches, Englisli, Scotch, and
Irish, but there is
little appearance of increase of population.
Here
I left n:y luggage, and a cask for Mr. Hemming, and
proceeded to his house, on foot, about four miles.
1 found Mr.
:>'id Mrs. Hemming, had gone
to Toronto,
and were not expected to return home before Saturday.
It was
..rraiiged
that Mr. Hennning's waggon
should go
to Guelph for the cask and luggage.
Having obtained dinner
liere,
I walked
on
four
miles
further, to
the house
of my
fr':;id George
Sockett,
in Eramosa who had accompanied
Mr. and Mrs.
II.
to Toronto.
I found
an industrious ser-
vant in
the field, who permitted me to take possession of his
master's house, and procured me every thing
I wished.
Here
I
passed
a few days quietly, and obtained some knowledge
of life in the woods.
July Sth.
At () A. M.
Set out from Eramosa, on the road
for Guelph, for 2*i
miles, then
turned to the right, towards
Garrafraxu,
for

miles
:
excellent
road
: good
laud, large
portiojis cleared
:
turned
to the left, for eight miles, through
tlKMvoods, full of swainj)s, and deep holes, and very bad, and
intricate
road,
but nmch
fine
land.
Got
at
last
into
the
AVaterloo
road, and
reached Mr. (iiilkison's, of Elora, in the
township
ot" Nichol, at the falls of th« Grand River, to a h'e
breakfast.
Crossed
the
Gra.-.d
River, by
an
excellent new
wooden
bridge
:
went with Mr. GilKi.>on, to see a saw mill,
wiiich he has erected, and to viev.- the falls, from a high pro-
jecting
point, or
angle,
at
the junction of the
Irvhie, and
Grand
River, the water rushing impetuously over a shelving
bed of limestone.

of the evening,

of

to whom he vould introduce me, as he was ex-
pected to be there this day.
From Mr. Gilkison's house, which stands on the high elevated
bank of the Grand River, overlooking
the falls,
I
observed a
most wonder<^al commotion in the
air.
The dark, gathering
clouds,
surcharged with
rain,
rushed
in.
all
directions, like
radii from the circumference, to the centre of a
circle
:
then
assuming a circular motion, like a whirlpool, ,videly extending,
and
violently
agitated by
its rocky
barriers.
The contest
lasted
about twenty minutes,
and was quickly
followed, by
tremendous peals of thunder,
lightning,
and
rain, accompa-
nied by a
violent torrent of wind, which laid ])rostrate, the
huge
trees
of the forest.
"There goes one, right across my
fence !" said Mr. Gilkison, as
it fell.
The grandeur of
this
scene was beyond description.
This circumstance prevented
our projecLeil excunsion.
Mr.
Gilkison's
hospitable
roof afforded me shelter from
the
storm, anil accommodation for the
night.

is exposed to the dangers of the forest, at sucii

July 9th.—At
(3 A. M.
Left Elora,
in company
with
a
younger brother
of Mr.
Gilkison, a solicitor
at Toronto, on
ins way home, by Gait and Brandtford
:
we passed through
^Voolwich, for ten miles, very good land, but bad roads.
At 9 A. M.
We
breakfasted at the house
of a
farmer,
named Beames, twelve miles from Elora: charge very mode-
rate;
Is. 3d. self, and horse.
Accompanied Mr.
Gilkison,
for two and a half
miles, in
Waterloo, a light sandy soil, and excellent roads.
Turned off
to the right, at
about hrteen miles
above Gait
;
crossed
the
Grand
liiver,
at a
fine gravelly ford, for Sch;. eider's mills
;
much land highly cultivated, before I reached the river. Some
good land on
the opposite
side, in a wild
;>tate
:
1,200 acres
belonging to an American.
The
si,il in Waterloo, very light,
su.idy loam; At
noon leached
Schneider's mill.
Proceeded
through AVilinot.
Soil of a sandy loam,
excellent ro;id, hilly
land, much
cleared on the
road.
Settlers
chiefly
Dutch.
Much
difficulty to obtain
c(»rn for my
horse.
At
1
P. M,
came to the house of Amos C'rcsmonde, a fi!rmer, where I ob-
tained plenty of corn and grass for my horse
;
bread, butter,
eggs, and
milk,
for
myself.
Rested here one hour
:
very
moderate charge,
Is. 3d.
Learned that
1 was
travelling
in
too high
a
parallel
for Goderich, by about three miles
: re-

33
traci (1 my steps
abotit a mile.
Crossed
:i wood of very fine
tinibtT, luul lar^c pines, for a mile and a half, to Abb's
mills,
A^•here there is a creeU to cross.
Found people employed
in
repairing the bridge
;
twelve feet, at
least, uncovered or in-
toinplete,
with corduroy
loi!;s,
and no
M'here
else to cross,
Avitliout returning ahoul
tliree miles.
In this dilemma,
I met
^^•ith an instance
of the greatest eiviiity
:
the workmen left
their work;
crossed the creek
to the saw
mill; and covered
the bridge w!th plank;;, tliat my horse miglit pass .>ver.
Here
1 found a
hn\''c tract of cleared hmd, lUther flat, and
an excel'ent road, leading N. W. on my former paraUel.
At 4 P. M. I observed the clouds gathering in the distance,
a'ul anticipated the coming storm.
I had not proceeded more
than a laiie and
a half, when
1 perceived the people
leaving
their work,
in
the
field, and
hastening to their homes.
I
asked one of these men, if he would allow me to take

About two

I came
to Smith's
Creek
:
steep
banks
: fnnn which
I
turned
to the left, into
a
line
of road
lately
cut through
the wood, for two milps,
which brought me
to Cushnum's mill, on the opposite side
of the river.
Here
I got over by the aid of a large tree, laid
across below the mill dam
:
the
tree
answering
tlie double
purpose, of a path for the foot -aveller, and security to the
horse, against the rapidity, and i.jpth of the stream.
I now
learned, tliat 1 had been
traversing, for two miles, a narrow
neck
(»f land, surroumled by the same (Smith's; Creek, and
that it made a third
turn, suddenly, and came back, a little
below the mill.
Mr. Cushman and his son
in law have 400
acres of land here.
On encpiiring of Mr. Cushman, whether
labourers were wanted
in
his
neighbourliood, he answered
yes:
very nuich.
I
then
told him,
that 1 had just brought

Two bridges were to be erected,
this summer,
across
tlie
creek to Ilelmor's, in North Easthope, which lay directly op-
posite, and is the first farm on the Huron Tract.
This would
shorten the distance 3 miles, and
at the same time,
avoid
a
very bad road, of six, which
is deep, and swampy, over pretty
undulating ground,
thickly covered with trees.
About 7

Sandy loam for 4 miles.
At about 5i
miles fror.i the Avon river, crcssed
a
stroasu
which they called Black Creek
: very gotjd land, in the town-
L '.ips of Ellice, and Downie. Met witli obstructions from trees
across
the
road.
Dr. Verral, from .Seaford,
in Sussex, was
residing
in Downie,
on
the left of the road,
where
he had
been settled about a

The landlord here

at
"Whirl, or Whirlpool Creek, to which he is going to remove.
Crossed the river, from which the immediate asceivt is steep,
and afterwards the ground
rises gradually, to a considerable
elevation: land not so good.
Met with occasional obstruction,
Irom fallen trees
Allowed the horse to feed for half an hour,
on the road side.
At 2
P. M.
Reached
Carron
l^rook, a pretty stream in
Ilibbcrt.
Good land
:
plenty of grass, for the horse;
but no
corn
:
bread, butter, and
milk, for myself,
but (for
the
first
time)
I
could
not get an
viSir.
Rested here an hour.
Ex-
])erienccd nmch
interruption iu my journey from fallen trees.
Jn one
half nule, between Carron Brook and Silver Creek,
I th
' there were about fifty large trees across the road
: the
horse
.'
'vver
the trunks of some of them, and
scrand)led
through
branches of
others.
I avoitled
some, by going
into
tlie wood,
in which
1 got
so deeply
entangled, from
a
succession
of
trees
ne\\ly
fallen, that
I
had
great
<liffi-
culty to regain the
roa;!,
and
at one
time, apprehended,
I
should
hare
been
obliged
to
return
to
Carron
Brook.
With much labour, and perseverance,
I at length succeeded
in reaching
Silver Creek, a
beaiitiful- stream,
in
McKillop,
about
six miles from Carron
lirook.
After
leaving
Silver
Creek,
I
still found
a few
trei's
across
the
road,
and no
persons
employed
in
clearing them away.
A
waggoner,
in
proceeding
eastward,
had
returned from
this
place, on
hearing of the great difficulties before him.
About two miles
from Silver Creek,
1 came to the trunk of a tree, of
full two
feet
diameter,
across
the
centre
of the
road,
over which
this waggoner must have driven.
At 7 P. M.
arrived at the
house of Mr. A'an Egman, in Ilullett, where
I remained
for
the night.
Here
I found one of the wi'ggoners, who had been
with me to
Blandford, and who was now returning en>pty,
from (loderieh, wliere he had been
with a
1o"m1 of
baggage.
He
said he had been
as far as the Silver Creek to day, from
whence he had been obliged to return, in conseciuence of the
fallen trees lying across the road, and had passed over the one
before mentioned.
This man v/cis very
attentive and obliging to me, in taking
care of my horse.
Here I found a Mr. Dickison, a son of Mr. Dickison, for-
merly
of Ciledswood, near Melrose, who
had
been
in
this
etmntry
twelve months,
and had some land
in the vicinity
;
about ten acres of Mhich
he had
cleared.

the river Avon,
lle'.'eived, at this
liouse, very kind and hospitable treatment
:
the best accommodation for myself : a good supper, and ex-
cellent bed
:
plenty of corn
&c.
for my horse
: and a good
breakfast with the family, next morning, for the very moderate
charge of four shillings, York, about 2s. (id.
English.
July 11 th.
Mr. Van Egmaii accompanied me six miles to
Vanderburgh's,
in
the township
of
Tucker
Smith.
The
river B" /field runs for some miles, nearly parallel to the road,
and at one place, before you
arrive at Vanderburgh's, comes
quite
close
to
it.
At
Hicks',
three
miles
further,
in
the township of Goderich, the
land begins
to be of inferior
(juality, and more
hilly,
but
having a considerable
descent
towards Lake Huron.
A gentleman, of the name of Pot, or
Pots,
had just
made
a
purckase
in
this
neighbourhood.
Rested here an hour, while my horse ate a little grass.
No
corn to be had.
At noon arrived at the town of Goderich, which is situated
on the
left bank of the
river
Maitland, upon a piece of
flat
land, of a sandy and gravelly soil, about half a mile
in length
and half a quarter wide, and about 200 or 300 feet above the
level of the water in Lake Huron, and the river.
There
is sufficient depth of water
in the harbour, for ves-
sels of considerable burthen, (juite close to the store, but the
access to
it, from the town,
is by a very steep descent.
The road for
thirty
miles
before you
reach
Goderich,
is
ns good
as our common turnpike roads
:
but the
land, for
eight miles,
in
its immediate
vicinity, is of inferior quality.
The
town, however,
is
fast
increasing, anid
being advan-
tageously
situated
for
trade, must
in time, become a place
of considerable importance.
The Canada Company's
Agent, Mr.
Prior, occupies the
best,
an<l most
pronnnent point
(suited to a signal station)
overlooking the harbour and lake.
On arriving here,
I found that Dr. Duidop, to whom I had
a letter of introduction, hud just returned home.
His house
stands on an
elevated
sitiuition, some distance up the
river,
on the opposite side, overlooking a grassy flat, of some hun-
dreds of acres, of a rich soil, and without
a
tree.
The only
spot of this description, I Imve seen in Canada.
I
crossed the
river,
by
a
ferry
boat, to
the house,
and
found the
Dr. at home.
He gave me a welcome reception,
and
insisted on my staying to dinner
: shewed me
particii-
larlj', the
rich
land which
iiis house overlooked, at present

30
rpsn'ved as coniinon prvsture, for tliprows of the iriliahitants
of the
town.
Dr. Dnuh)p remarked, that
it was the only
place he has Keen
in
the
country,
naturally free from trees,
of any con^idenihlc extent.
I mot here, Captain Dunlop, U. N.
who
is
livinic with
his brother,
the
Doctor,
ami
another
gentleman, employed
as surveyor under the
Canatla Com-
pany.
After dinner, Dr. Duidop, the Captain and the gentleman
referred to above, accompanied me to the mouth of the river,
M'here they made a
bla/.ing fire, on the beach, ju^t
at dark
:
laid a seine twice out
into
the
lake, by a
boat, and caught
about a lumdred
fish, consisting of bass, mullet, pike, &c.
.July 12th.
There are thirty houses
building, and a steatu
boat is almost ready to start. She is to run between (ioderich
and lake St. Clair.
Many purchases of land have been made
this season, on the river Maitland
: and many gentlemen arc
here, and
in
the
neighbourliood, looking out witli the same
object. The Canada Company have raised their price a little
.-
4|
dollars
per
acre,
being demanded
a!id
given,
for
fn)iit
lots
:
this may probably, prove
injudicious, considering how
great a temptation
is held <mt to the man of small
capital,
in
tlie neighl)ouring territory of Michigan, where the price is on-
ly
1 \
<lollar
per
acre.
This circumstance seems worthy of
consideration both by our Government, and the Company.
A procession of about
fifty orange men, this day paraded
the
streets,
twenty
of them
with
scarfs
and
badges,
the
authorities doubting whctiier they should interfere.
All how-
ever passed off quietly.
At 4. P. M.
Left
Goderich, and
returned by the road I
had before travelled, as far
as
Vanderl)\u'gh's
Imi,
eighteen
miles from (Joderich.
Tiiis house
is situated at the north west angle of the town-
ship of 'I'licker Smitli,
M-here
the
London
(or
as
it
is called
the Talbot)
Iload, joins that to (ioderich.
Here
I passed the
night, and was very comfortably ucconunodated.
July. 13th.
At 5 A. M.
Proceeded along the Loiuhm
road, which the workmen were just beginning to form.
After
travelling
ab<mt
four
miles,
crossed
the
Haylield,
a
river
about
the
si/e
of the
Uotiu-r, ne:ir
Petworth, by a woocieu
bridge: the lanil now good. About two miles further, crossed
a small creek or brook.
Tne land now
very
good,
slightly
and
prettily
undulated.
The
size
and
description
of the
trees, the best.
Near
this place,

Tm'o miles further, arrived at Clark
Ilillick's, hut could not
ol)tain any corn, therefore rode on about six miles further, to
J>Ic Connel's.
Just bcfoi'c arriving at thia luuise,
I croBsod
a considerable
stream, to which
the pecple
I'cn*
gave
the nan\c
of Great
Sable
creek, but which
1 am
inclined to
think, is
the one
named Benson
creek, in the Canada Company's map.
Here I obtained corn for my horse
: bread, milk, and veni-
son, for myself
: and after
resting
about an hour, proceeded
on my journey.
At the end of the
first
mile, crossed a small creek
:
at the
end of the second mile, another: and at three miles, a third.
About the end of tlie sixth mile, the road tiu'iied at a right
angle, to the W.
and continued
in
that
iliri i-tion, for one
quarter
of a mile,
then turned
to the
S.
skirling
a beaver
swamp, for a inilc, when
it returned
to the
1'^. for about one
half mile, then resutncd its origimd line, nearly S.
The road
for several miles, in the vicinity of the swamp, was very bad.
About seven
miles
from
this
place, there
is
a considerable
portion of cleared land, belonging to a person of the name
of Adamson.
Here the road again turns to the E. and runs
\\\ the same
line nearly on
a level
for two
miles
:
then
one and a
half
further, with
considerable
descent, to a stream called by the
people,
the
Little Sable
creek,
over which
there
is a good
bridge,
the
ascent from which
is
very
steep.
Here
is
a
black
settlement
:
the
people
are
orderly, ckan, and appa-
rently comfortable.
The road
runs
S.
E. from
the
above
named creek, four and a half miles
:
v.here
after
passing a
sudden steep descent, and crossing a beaver meadow about a
tjuarter of a
mile,
1
arrived by a
short ascent, at Mrs. Mc
Connel's, in the township of London, where
I
stopped
for
the night.
Good acconunodation for my horse and self, with
venison for supper.
Near the house,
is a fine elevated situa-
tion, but the view
is obstructed by the uncleared forest.
At the foot of this
hill,
about
half a mile distant, there
is
a
creek which ^!rs. Mc Connel says, the roi'd crosses three
times, before you reach London.
1 had th!
.ly passed over
a tract of very good land, for about 18 or
'2i) miles, lying in
the townships of Stanley, Tucker Smith, Hay, Usborne, and
Stephen.
The
road
through
this
tract
is
straight,
and
throujjhuut the whole distance nearly level.

Ctime to a mill
: proceeded along the boundary
line, between

and
Lobo.
Much

land,
uncleared.
Very
bad road. Crossed some difficult passes, over creeks; swamps;
and a river running through a deep glen or ravine, probably
into the Aux
Sables.
The
last twelve
miles, having taken
me about five hours to travel.
At noon arrived
at
Curtiss's, near
the boundary between
Lobo and
Adehiide,
to
breakfast.
Plenty
of corn
for my
liorse
: rested here two hours.
Proceeded along the boundary
line,
between
Adelaide and
Lobo.
Road unformed
:
very
bad
:
difiicult to trace niy way-
At () P. ^L
Arrived
at
Captain White's, in Lobo, where
J stopped for the night, and
obtained very satisfactory infor-
mation respecting tlie
Sussex
settlers
in
Adelaide, not only
from Captain While, but
also from one of the settlers them-
selves, named Phillips, late of Merston, near Chichester, who
went out
in
IHIJ.'i, to
join
his
son, who had
settled in that
township in 1KJ2.
Captain
White, and
Phillips, both confirmed the report
which
I had previously heard, that the principal road through
Adelaide was almost impassable, and that
I should not find
my
\\ ay by the concession lines, without a guide.
This being
tlie case, and the information
I
had
here rcjcived, being so
full and
satisfactory,
I
therefore gave up my
intention
of
passing into that township.
July
l.')th.— At 5 A. M.
Set
out
for Delaware:
passed
for2i miles, between Lobo and Carradoc
: good land in both
townships, passed tlirough the centre of Lobo.
The northern
half is good land
;
and thesouthv'rn half very poor
:
chiefly
a
reddish
s»nd,
thinly
covered with small oak trees, like a
gentleman's park
:
ornamental ground
:
but not
profitable.
Koads very good
: crossed the river Thames into the township
of Delaware, by the bridge nearest to London. The bridge is
very good, but the access on both sides,
is very steep.
Passed
south about 10 miles, into Wcttmin>tcr, wlurc I brcakfafctcd.
i4

39
Proceeded through Westminster, and Soxitlunohl, to port Tal-
bot, and to the residence of Col. 'I'tilbot on Lake Erie
: here I
rested for the
night.
The approach
to
the house loads for
about three miles, along a lofty ridge, through the most beau-
tiful avenue of beeches
I ever
saw, from which you descend
abruptly,
cross a creek, and tine grassy dell, and from thence
ascend a cleared eminence, of considerable extent to the house,
which is situated at a short distance from the Lake, but does
not ovcx'look
it.
Colonel
Talbot
received,
and
treated me
very hospitably
; and amongst other good things I partook of
here,
was the best ale
I had
tasted in Canada.
When
I re-
tired to rest,
the Colonel
himself,
in the old style of the old
country, conducted me to my chamber, where
1 soon forgot
the privations and toils
I had so
recently experienced
in the
forest.
July ICth.—At 5 A. M.
Left Colonel Talbot's, and
re-
turned through Southwold and Westminster. These townships
are chiefly flat
;
but towards the lake slightly undulating, aiul
of a clay soil, mixed
with
sand.
The
land
is
extensively
cleared.
I observed a better description of horses
; and every
thing indicating a people enjoying superior comforts.
Were
it not for the rail fences, and the want of hedges, one might
imagine himself in some well <;ultivated
district
in England.
At 2 P. M.
Arrived in London by
a bridge across the
S.
E. branch of the Thames.
In the descent to the bridge, where the town opens sudden-
ly to the view,
I overtook a Mr. Crawley, a
farmer, in West-
minster, whom I accompanied to the inn, where he was going
to stop.
In the course of conversation, he said he had heard
from Mr. Hatch, of the people
I had brought out
:
that they
were of the right description
:
and he hoped more
\yould
follow, as they were nmch wanted in the country.
The same
remark was made, and the same wish expressed, wherever
I
made myself known.
Having a letter of introduction to Mr. Askew, government
land agent here, Mr. C accompanied me to
his office.
Iwlr-
C,
asked me on the way what
1
thought
of Westminster.
On my answering, that
1
did not like
a
clay soil.
He said.
He thought with me, when he first came out, but that having
a portion/)f sand in it, it did not bind like clay land in England.
I do not however much like either clay or sand soil. Mr. Askew
confirmed the opinion of Mr. Crawley, that
a
superior class
of mechanics and labourers would readily find employment, in
this neighbourhood.

corner of Durham, t^velvc miles fnnn Oxford,
aiul

Land
and roads good, and scenery pretty, as you approach Oxford.
About six miles from Oxicr.l, met Mr. Hatch.
Having passed throu^'h
O.'.forJ, which
is
beautifully
si-
tuated between two elevated ridL^es,
I waited for half an hour,
and
fed my horse
with
excellent
clover
on

side,
waitintj
f(U' Mr.
Hatch
;
.is
lit- did
not come up,
I went on.
Shortly aitcruards
1
met Mr. Bullen, and
subsecpiently Mr.
Alexander came
ruiminp^ to
me, irom a small hut,
followed
by Rivers, ^^ho had got employment here, about three or four
iidles Ircm Hlandford, with a !Nlr. Groves.
On entering tlie township
of Blandford,
I saw W. Martin,
and Abraham Muzzle, finishing the roof of a IraniL' house.
At
F) P. M.
Arrived at the liousc of Mr. Hatch, who soon
afterwanh^ returned home.
July IHth.—Occupied for a considerable portion of this day
in prosecuting an cnijuiry, respecting a cask belonging to the
Rapson's, which had unfortunately been lost during our jour-
ney up the coimtry, but without success.
Accompanied Mr. Hatch to inspect the huts. M'hich
I found
all ready, several of them finished in a superior manner, with
regular roofs,
instead of the one sided lean-to appearance of
the shanty
:
this had been
effected, either by the
individual
exertions of the rispective
families themselves^
or,
iji somo

41
instances, by a
trifling sum
of nioiu-y paid hy them, to the
Govi'iiiniont contnicloi.
I dbsc-rvcd tliat ('oleniaii, Ditton,
Gamblin,
Martin,
anil
Voice, hull hern vising with each oilier, who should have the;
most comfoilahlo hut.
Oitton had thatched his
wilh straw,
wliich Mr. Hatch had given him
:
this
sort of covL>riii:^- win
quite
a. novelty in this part of the country.
It was most sntisfactory to me, on my return to Bhuiilford,
at the end of a mciith from the time
I left
it, to
lind
all the
people in
full employment.
Cornelius Voice, from Rillingahurst, Sussex, told me, that
it was impossihle for him to escpress, how fortunate a circum-
stance his coming here had been
:
tliat himself, his two sons,
and his tiephew, were together, mtiking six pounds per week.
Mr. Barton, the only one who, on my first leaving IJland-
ford,
I appn.hend'jd, might
not find
suitable
employment,
had been appointed
schoolmaster, and parish
clerk, and his
prospects were now amongst the best.
The Church had
been opened
:
and
several of our people
expressed to me their regret, that 1 had
not returned a week
kiooner, to have been present at the ctTcmony.
One of them
said.
"Jf'e conducted the singing ; and you would have liked
to have heard us."
I may here remark,
that during our voyage, it wa:' pleasing
to see, the very respectable appearaiice made by the emigrants,
in the neatness and cleaidiness of their dress, when they came
on deck, to attend the service of the church on Sundays.
I should
also
not omit
to
observe,
that the
very
liberal
supply of books,
sent
down
to
us
at
Portsmouth, by the
Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, was j)articularly
acceptable, and useful, to our emigrants
; and that
I also had
an opportunity, of distributing a few of them,
I
hope with
good effect, among those
already
settled
in the
upper pit)-
vince.
July
lOth.—IJefore
I
finally left lllandford,
it was
truly
gratifying to n)e, to
witness, the removal
of all the
faniilies
from the barns, where they had been lodged, into the separate
and comfortable ajiodes,
I trust of peace
anil ha[)piness5 pro-
vided for them.
I was tiuis enabled, with peculiar satisfaction
to myself, to
leave these people, in M'hose welfare I had taken a deep interest,
and for whom
I
had felt a
considerable
degree
of .mxiety,
contented and
happy,
in the
prospect now ojiencd to them,
of present comfort, and ultimate independence.

rises gradually to a very considerable
ele-
vation
;
the soil
is rather of inferior (piality, and thinly cover-
ed with oidi trees.
Observed several small lakes amongst the
lolls, nearly on the top of the highest land, fron) which
I de-
scended for some
miles, as
I approached
the grand river at
Gait, in
tlie vicinity of which, the scenery is very fine
: lime-
stone prevails here, in great ab\n>dance.
Dined at Gait, and
afterwards, proceeded on to Waterloo.
About a mile and a
half beyond this place,
I crossed the Speed, and having turned
short to the
left, went on about a mile and a half, and crossed
the grand ri\er, by a wooden bridge,
roofetl over to keep
off
the snow.
About two and a half miles further,
I arrived at
the huts of the Rapson's, late
of Lodsworth,
Sussex,
about
half an hour before dusk, and afterwards returned to Water-
loo, for the night, where
I met with excellent aceonunodation.
July 22ud.— Left Waterloo for Guelph.
After travelling
about three miles, crossed the Speed.
For six miles the land
is hilly, and irregular.
For six miles before you reach Guelph,
the road is
;o()d, and runs in a straight line: the land
is good
here, with aijundance of limestone.
Limestone abounds ge-
nerally in Upper Canada.
Reached Guelph to breakfast, and
afterwards,
proceeded to
Eramosa,
and
again returned
to
Guelph.
Mr. and Mrs. Huntley have purchased 200 acres,
and settled here.
July 23rd.—At 7 A. M.
Quitted Guelph
in
a waggon
(called a
coach)
for passengers, and luggage,
which
runs
three times a week, throu;j;h Puslinch, and West Flambro, to
Hamilton,
and
returns from
thence,
the
following
day, to
Guelph.
The
driver of the
waggon,
the
first stage
from

43
neloh, wns renmrkiihly civil.
Nothing is usually
tfivcn to
e
(Irivors in America.
The
vvajfgon, on
the strond staj;e
Guel|)h
the
was ilriven by Patcrson, the proprietor, who
is a respectable
inteHi((ent man.
By the aid of a pair of good horses, and ail
obliging and attentive driver, I passed once more over a very
bad road, for eight or ten miles, through a thick and heavily
timbered
forest, which
fortunately
protected
us from
the
scorching rays of the sun, during a sultry day.
At 5 P. M.
Stopped at Dundas to feed the horses.
At
7
P- M.
Reached
Hamilton, and
found
that
the
thermometer this, and some prcvioui
days, had ranged from
ninety, to ninety five degrees.
July 24th.—Ueturned from
Hamilton, by the
Queenston
steam boat, to Toronto.
I
fell in with a
Mr. Durand from Warwick,
in the
boat,
who gave me a very favourable account of some of th» Sussex
emigrants.
At 7 P» M.
Arrived at Toronto,
and
again
look up my
quarters at the Ontario house.
July 2.5th.—Called on A. B. Hawke, Esq. and settled some
accounts, which
had been
arranged
with
Mr.
Cattermole,
respecting the victualling
of the people, from Hamilton, to
Blandford.
The victuallijig cost £10.
The steam boat, from Toronto
to Hamilton, £'20. the victtudling and lodging
one
night
at
that place £5.
the fourteen waggons about £70, besides tlie
passage
of twenty men, from Toronto through the Welland
canal,
to
the works
in the Grand
river,
by
the
schooner
Superior, about
£'5. amounting
together to £\ 10. currenc)',
or about one hundred guineas
:
the whole of which, was paid
by Government.
I had an audience of his
Excellency, in which
1
reported
to him, the very conifortal)le state
I
f(jund our emigrants in,
on my return to them, at the end of a month after their loca-
tion,
that
all
were
in
full employment,
contented
and
happy.
His Excellency was much pleased to hear so favourable a
report, and said,
thitt
although he could not
give the same
assistance to all, who came out, he would
still, do every thing
in
his power,
particularly for large families.
That he
h;nl
represented to
the Secretary
for the Colonics, that he could
receive 100,000 emigrants annually
;
that he -would find em-
ployment
for
all, wlio came
out
;
that it was a part of his
plan, to set them to work,
in cutling down
the
timber, and
-^Ji_

44
clearing tlie land, not in such away, as would enable them
trt
make hicfh wages; but at the usual rnte, paid in
tV":
colony,
for such labour
; and so as to
provide them wi^.h the
means
of subsistence, until they could do bf tter for themselves
:
that
the purchasers of land would repay this expence
;
and
that
it would be to the advantage
of tliem to do
so,
in order
to
possess a pction ready cleared, the moment of their arrival,
at as low a rate as they th'Mnselves could effect
it
:
but
that
ultimately, the labourers must depend on their own ext.":ioiiS.
He repeated
that
his plan was,
to
find employment for all.
July 30th.—Left Toronto, by the steam
boat for Niagara,
from whence I proceeded by coach, to the Falls.
The view
of the river Niagara,
as
it passes between the perpendicular
rocky heights of Queenaton
and
Lewiston,
is
very
grand.
Indications of red freestone, are observed in the banks of the
ri.'cr.
At 6
P. M.
Arrived
at the Falb.
I did not hear tl.eir
sound,
owing
to
the
noise
of
the
coach,
v
til
within
a
mile
or
two
of
tlie
pavilion.
My
first
cw
from
the
top
of
this
house, which
overlooks
them,
was
a
slight,
but temporary
d'-appointnient
: descending to take a nearer
view from a position where you rather look up
to the great
body of water, rushing with
increased
velocity
(by passing
a'.ong
a
shelv'ng
rocky descent for some distance) and then
falling
perpendicularly, you
are struck with the awful gran-
deur of the
scene, aiul become
more, and more,
impressed
with
it,
as you
contemplate
the continued
descent of the
Uiighty mass into the abyss below
;
half filled, as it were, by
a cream like foam ai:d
spray,
cojitinually rising up into a va-
pour,
gradually
becomiiig less and
less dense, until it is lost
in the distance, yet
still renewed
; and
in which you may
observe the
swallows,
like small
black
specks, fiitting, and
sporting, and half concealed.
The rays of the sun
b^
day, or nioon by
night, passing
through the vapour, present all the coloun
,/» the rainbow.
.TuiySlst.—Spent
the day
with my
friend
Col. Delitre,
who settled in Canada with his family, in IKW.
He i^ highly
delij^hted
with
the
country general'y, and particularly with
the vicinity
of the Falls of Niagara, about a mile and a half
from
wliicii,
at Lundy's Lane, he
has purchased 200
acres
and
is building a very good hcmse, having already most con-
vcnient oHices, aiul out-houses of every description.
He keeps
his
close
carriage,
gig and sleigh, aiul has all
the enjoyments of the best English society; Gen. Murnrv, and

4.5
S;
ten or twelve other gentlemen, of great
respectabilitj^, living
in the neighbourhoocl, within an easy visiting distance.
The
Colonel
has
also
purchasi-d a
considerable quantity of land
in the tow?iship of Blandford.
A\igust
1st.
Left the Falls for Queenston, where I crossed
the river Niagara, by ferry boat to Lewiston, in
the
United
States, and from thence proceeded by coach, to Lockport.
Travelled this day, over a
large
tract of cleared land, of a
clay soil, but not well
watered.
For the last nine miles, <he
road
M'ns
excellent ; and passed ah)ng a natural sandy ridge,
of
slight
elevation, and
sixty or eighty
feet
wide.
This is
called the ridge way.
The canal to Buffalo, is cut through a
horizontal
schistus
rock,
at Lockport,
for
a considerable distriuce, where there
is a double set of locks.
August 2nd.—Proceeded by coach
along
the same kind
of ridgo as in the latter
part of yesterday, as far as Orchard
creek
Passed
Liiulen and Gains, on
the left hand, in the
distance.
At 6 P. M.
arrived !it Rochester, and immediately
embarked
in
the canal
track
boat,
Montgomery,
Captain
Couch, which was waiting the arrival of the coach.
A
track boat
is drawn by two horses
; and carries heavy
goods,
and
jiassengcrs,
and their
luggage
; travelling from
two aiul a half to three miles per hour, day aiul night.
I paid two and a half cents, about three halfpencr
English,
per
mile, for my
passage
in
this
boat,
vitualhig,
and
sleeping berth,
included.
An
English
halfpenny passes for
a cent, all oicr America.
Tlie same
description
of boat,
carrying
passengers,
and
their
luggage,
and
light
goods
only, and drawn
by
three
li»,rses,
is callcl a packet boat; and travels at the rate of four
miles an hour, day and night.
I ro'^retted the want of time, to
visit the beautiful Falls of
the Genesee river, of ninety si'ven feet: Sam Patch's last U ..p.
Uochester
is a large and fliiurishing town
:
already suih-
cie"tly described by travellers.
The canal passes ov.^r the (ienesee, by an
aquediu't of 8()4
feet long, on eleven aVches, from twenty six to
til'ty feet opun,
and
f(nu*teen
feet
al ove
the river, constructed oi
ireestone,
at a cost of 80,000 dollars.
There
is a fl»)uring mill at this place, of fifty three pairs of
stones, which can
grind 24,0(JO bushels of wheat, in twenty
four hours.
Ten miles
from Rocheetcr, is
Pitsford
:
twelve miles from

tmmm
wp
46
Roclieatcr, the canal runs along the slope
of a hill,
for
the
distanee of two miles, banked up on the other side sixty or
seventy feet from the valley.
Fullom's basin is sixteen miles from Rochester by canal, but
only seven and a half, by land.
August 3rd.— At 5 A. M.
At Palmyra, about 30 miles
from
Rochester,
the canal
passes
in a
hollow,
with high
ground on each side, land poor, consisting of stones and gravel,
and bcidly watered.
Port Gibson, six miles from Palmyra, and 125
miles from
Utica, is a pretty place.
Thirty
miles from
Port Gibson and 95 miles
from Utica,
came to a lake, and marshy meadow.
August 4th.—At 6 A.M.
Arrived
at lake Salina, where
there are salt works, a well being dug into the
salt rock, 190
feet, at Geddesburgh by the side of the canal.
In one house
there are twenty
eight boilers,
containing from
ninety,
to
one hundred
gallons
each.
Fifty
six gallons of water
will
produce 5Glbs. of salt.
The
towns
of Salina and Liverpool
are
situated
on
lake Salina.
At Syracuse, an extensive valley of very good land, surroun-
ded by
a
high mountainous
range,
at
the distance of from
three to five miles.
Three hundred acres of land arc here used for evaporating
salt in the sun, the water being brought a mile and a half, by
pipes from the lake.
A
canal
to Oswego,
branches
off
at
Syracuse,
distance
thirty eight miles.
August 4th.—At Syracuse
140 miles from Schenectady, a
labourer or unwashed
artisan, joined the
boat,
took off
his
shoes, and stretched himself out, on one of the four cushions,
or scats, in the cabin, in his dirty stockings, in a very hot day,
the thermometer about 95.
August 5th.—Another of the unwashed, without stockings,
came on board the boat, took off his shoes, and also stretched
himself out, on another of the cushions in the cabin, with his
bare
hoofs, regardless
of the decencies due
to
old men or
women, young men, or niiiidens.
Let no one, who wishes to receive agreeable impressions of
American manners, couunence his travels in a lake Erie canal
boat.
The
canal passes through
the
valley of the Mohawk, one
hundred miles, where the low land is good, but the surround*
ing hills gravelly, rocky, and barren.

47
August 6th.
At 7 A. M.
Arrived at Schenectiuly, by tow
bout, a distance of two hundred and forty miles, for six doUars,
inchiding victualling
for three and a half days.
Breakfasted
ftt Schenectady, and proceeded to Albany by steam carriage,
fourteen miles,
over the worst
description
of land,
I have
ever seen.
Albany is a very beautiful town, finely situated on
the N.
W.
side of the Hudson, on a steep ascent.
Some
of the
public buildings, are handsome.
I'he town house in particu-
lar, is built of marble, from Sing Sing.
It has a large hand-
some entrance hall, leading
by
a
ueautiful
stair
case,
to
a
Testibule, from which you enter the rooms and offices, of the
town and county Courts of Justice, wiiich are elegantly fitted
up.
One is shocked and disgusted however, with the stained
floor, and stair
case
;
in every turn,
and corner
of which,
etands
a
stjuare box, ready
to
receive
filthy
contributions,
from the consumers of the nauseous and deleterious tobacco
plant.
I
observed on
the
walls, about the
town, the foUowuig
placard.
** Jackson and the people, against the Emperor
Nicholas,
" and
his gold
;
the Democracy
against money,
and
" family influence.
The true friemls of the eoil against
*' the worshippers of the Golden Calf."
August 6th.—Obtained from the office of Thaddeus Joy, at
the
foot of State S.treet, Albany, the
following information,
respecting
the expence of conveying Emigrant
from New
York to Albany, antl from thence along the caii.u
From New York to
Aibfxny, per steam boat, on the ri^
r
Hudson, including an idlowance of 1001 bs.
luggage, for
each person, one dollar
:
the overplus of luggage paying
Tii cents, per lOOlbs.
Passengers on the canal to any point, in all cases including
501bs. luggage, pay
1 i cents ^ler mile each passage, ex-
clusive of board: they have the
privilege
of cooking in
the boat, and the. use of cooking utensils.
In case of a large number of piissengers, who may wish to
be boarded on the canal,
the
expcnce
will not
exceed
thirty seven
and a half cents per day, for each.
Passengers wishing to go to any part of Ohio, Michigan,
or to any port on lake
Ontjirio,
will always
find steam
boats, at Bufl'alo, Rochester, or Oswego, to convey them
at a reasonable price, without delay.

Angust 6th.—At 5 P. M.
Embarked at Albany, on board
tlio steam boat, in the river Hudson.
The banks of the river
lise into hills of consi(leral)le elevation, on both
sides.
The
scenerj' on
the banks
of the Hudson, viewing
it with the
ey<"
of a landscape
painter,
is
\nuloubtedly
beautiful;
but
the land in the eye of the agriculturist,
is, comparatively, of
little value.
The
river Hudson
however,
possesses many
excellent
situations,
on
its
banks, which may become the
residence,
and
retreat
of
those,
M-ho
have
been
long
accumuhiting
dollars, in the thronged and busy city of New York.
August 7th.—At 5 A.M.
Arrived
at New York, break-
fasted, and afterwards occupied
in making arrangements for
my passage
to England, by the American Packet,
(Indepen-
dence), Captain Nye, for Liverpool.
The Independence, was
elegantly,
and superbly fitted up,
with beautiful specimens of maple pamielling.
The day being exceedingly hot ('l'hernu)meter 95)
while
I
was engaged in this business,
1 observed, on crossing
in
the
lower part of Wall street, some workmen employed in repairing
it, and one of them in the act of drawing a panoicanof water
from a pump
;
1 accosted
him. and said,
1 should feel nmch
obliged, if he would give me a little water.
He replied, yes!
when I have drank.
He drank accordingly, and then present-
ed me the empty pannican.
I
doubt whether any English,
Scotch,
or
Irishman, would
have
shown
so
little
civihtv.
Another workman,
possibly not au American, who had ob-
served what
passed,
took the parinican, filled
it with
M'ater
from the pump, and ga\e it to me.
It has been remarked, that
no beggars are seen in the
streets
of the principal towns, in
the united states of America;
but M'hile
sitting in
the open
air, with some
other gentlemen,
in
froi
t of Niblo's hotel, in
the Broadway,
in
the evening
oi the 7^1'-
'^"f?"st, two
boys
came, to solicit charity
of me, and
the
following
v»iorning,
M'hile sitting in the same place, a girl presented
herself, witii
the
like
object.
As
I remained
only thirty hours in New
York,
I
caimot say
whether these are common occurrences,
or otherwise.
August Hth.—At noon.
Thermometer 92.
I embarked
in the Eagle steam boat, and at one P. M., was put on boiird
the packet, which was towed out of the harbour.

than a fort-
niglit in

and
were
returning,
dissatisfied and
disappointed, because they had not been able to find employ-
ment at New York.
Six persons, who had not paid for their
passage, liad secreted
themselves on board,
but were disco-
vered in time to be sent back by the pilot boat, which left the

GENERAL OnSERVATIONS.
Iluvliij; made the
exteiuled
circuit, described in
tliis nar-
rative
;
1 proceed now, to offer such opinions, on the different
routes
to Upper Ciinuda—tlie
state of that country gene-
rally—tlie
care
necessary
in
making
purchiises
of land
the system adopted by
(jlovernment
in making grants—and
the proper method of convoying emigrants
to
the
colony
as the information actjuired, and my own personal experience
and observation have enabled me to form.
I
I prefer the route to Toronto by Montreal, Rideau Canal,
and
Kingi-^toii;
to that by New York, the
Erie Canal, and
Oswego,
for the following reasons.
The expence
of freight
to
Montreal, will be
less than to
New York,
in
consecpience
of the
great number of
ships
proceeding to
the St. Lawrence in
the
spring, and summer,
for cargo
;
while there
are few, or no English ships to New
York, with the like object.
If the voyage
be
undertaken
about
the
middle, or
latter
end of April,
it may be accomplished in the same period of
time, or at most, two or three days more, than to New York,
and witii perfect
safety; provided a
fit
ship be engaged, and
the master gives proper care and attention, to his vessel.
Emigrants,
if proceeding in
a body, should go on, in their
ship the whole distance to Montreal, 180 miles from Quebec;
by so doing, they avoid the great trouble and inconvenience
attendant upon
landing
their
luggage, at the
latter port, or
even shifting
it on board a steamer, which may probably be
so crowded,
as to afford accommodation very inferior to that
they have been accustomed to, in the ship.
They can procure at Montreal a decked
boat, which
will
come along side the ship, and at
once, take
the
people and
baggage on board, without the trouble of landing, and re-cm-
barking it,or them.
Such
a boat as
I procured, and have
described, affords the people every requisite accommodation,
ample protection, and
shelter, from
all weather,
either the
heat
of the sun by day, or the cold by
night, while passing
through the Uideau cnnal, and they and
their baggage
will

51
remain, undisturbed,
ti circumstance of the greatest importeince
until
thoy
reacli
Kint^ston;
from whence
there
are steam
boats daily, to Toronto: the whole coat from Montreal to that
city, being IDs.
per
passage, including one cwt. of luggage,
for each
ptissa^e.
Thus from
Portsmouth, all the way
to
Toronto, only
three ditrorcnt kinds
of conveyance would be
employed, namely, the
ship
to
Montreal
;
the decked boat
from Montreal to Kingston; and the steanier, from Kingston
to Toronto.
Whereas by tlie New York line, four different
kinds of conveyance must be employed
;
namely
, the ship to
New York, the steamer from New York to Albany, the track
boat from Albany to Oswego, a steamer, or other vessel, from
Oswego to Toronto.
Our passage from Montreal to Kingston, from some trifling
accidental occurrences, occupied eight days, and some hourd,
althougli usually |)crf()i*.ned in seven
d.iys.
At
present,
the
llidcau canal
is in
its infancy, several parts of
it are
narrow,
many impeded by stumps, and loose floating trees
:
in some
places, there is a sudden turn, with but just room for the steam
boat
to
enter the
passage, where,
by the removal of about
twenty stumps, from the angle,
it could be easily widened one
half.
In one place we passed through
a large
lake, covered
with
floating
islands,
formed of the trunks of trees, matted
together
l)y
eoiirse
grass,
and
covered
witli
small
shrubs,
over one of which, our boat, towing along
side the steamer,
was carried.
'i'he steam boats, employed on the
llldeau
canal,
neither
possess the proper form, nor power for the work.
At least
such was the ease with the
'I oronto, an old boat, nearly worn
out, on the river Ottawa, where she had been employed pravi-
ously to the opening of the
Rideau, by wliich we had
the
ill
luck to be dragged along.
I am
fully
satisfied however, that this part of the journey
may, and will be accomplished, in six days
:
in less
time, at
less cxpence,
and with much less trouble and
danger, than
from New York, by tjie Erie Canal and Oswego, which pas-
sage cannot be accomplished
in less than
seven days.
The
charge by steam boat, to Albany, including lOOlbs. of baggage,
one dollar
;
from thence to Oswego 209 miles, at
1 { cents per
mile, tlirea dollars and a (piarter,
but including only
half a
cwt. of luggage from Albany to Oswego.
The
cost
of the
other half cwt. would consi(leral)ly increase the expence, by
this route, ;dready exteeiling that of tlie Rideau.
Moreover,
there
is not
the smallest probability of the cxpence on
the
u

TaViv
oan!\l boins; reduced, as
i« evident, from the
follonting
extract of
letter of Thaddcus Joy, Chairman of the board of
forwarders,
to
A.
C.
Flugg,
of the Comptrollers
office,
Albany.
July 10th. 1834.—Tiie forwarders on
thi«
canal,
feel
a
lively
interest in doini^
all
in their power, to make the
New York and Ohio canals,
a desirable channel for the
conveyance of merchandise,
but
I am frank
in
sayinj^,
that
I do
not believe a
/esfi rate, than

And moreover, no one covered fjoat on tlie Eric canal, could
have
contained
our vThole
party, and to have divided tlieni,
would have hcen productive of considerable inconvenience.
The personal safety of emigrants, on the Erie canal, is much
endangered, by the frequent
occiu'rence
of bridges, which
cross
it almost at every mile, or mile and a
hiilf, and arc oidy
about three feet above the top of the boat.
Tlie
following
extract is a strong corroboration of what
1 say.
*' The boats too, are made narrow
and confined, to ensure
speed, and
a
very little inadvertence,
in moving about, may
leave you
in the lurch.
While on
deci\ this
forenoon, my
attention was attracte<l by a splash, the boat going at a good
rate, and on
looking
round,
to my consternation,
I
beheld
(Jeorge, a fellow of ten
years
old, in the centre of the canal,
sticking erect, like Tantalus, with the water at hW; chin.
He
was
speedily relieved, without
furtlier
danuige
than a
little
fright, and
a complete
soaking,
but had
it happened a few
yards further on,
the
event might have been very different,
as the
canal
there,
suddenly deepens.
It was altogether to
be considered, as a very providential escaj)e.
" The numerous low bridges over the canal, are extremely
aimoying, and require constant attention.
My youngest boy

happily without

a poor woman

almost
innumerable
houses
ah)ng the
canal, where
beer, and spirituous ll(iuors can
l)e
obtaiiird, at
a very cheap
rate, and the
facility
with
whieli the people can have access
to them, would render it a diilicult task to keep them together
and in order
; and make the duty
of a superintendent one of
great responsibility, and extreme
ditliculty, in the execution
;
while
along the
Rideau canal,
the temptations of
this
de-
scription, to which the people are exposed, are few.
A canal being also
imder formation on the St. Lawrence,
to avoid
the Lonf/
Saulf,
will, when accomplished, cause a
more powerful
competition
to
arise between
the forwarders
by
the
St. Lawrence,
and
th.e
Rideau,
than
that
which
already exists, from which the expence by both these routes,
may yet be considerably diminished.
It is also a matter of great importance, to British emigrants,
that they should pass through a tract inhabited by their own

throuijh the States, and the ri^^k ot being driven hack to their
native country, tlirongh
despair of finding work, as was the
case with many who
returned in the same ship with myself,
from New York.
Some emigrants are induced to prefer the United
States by
the low
price
of their
land; others may be enticed aAvay by
misrepresentation, in
passing
through
them.
Ajjainst
this
there is no
security,
livery American thinks higldy
of his
leannng
;
speaks well of hinuiclf, and of his country
; which
he represents, as the
best
In
the world.
It were well
if
he
stopped here; but alas
! most Aujoricans pride themselves on
their
sagacity,
acutenoss,
aiul
ingeimity,
in
over
reaching
their
neighboiu's.
(Jold
is tb.e idol of almost every
one of
them
: and fvw
of
f liose
with whom
the
poor emigrant
is
likely to have
transactions,
arc
of a
class to
be scrupulous
how they
obtain it.
Every settler in tlie States must take an oath, l)y which he
renounces his allegiance to his king, and native country (not
so in regard to an American, settling
in Canada).
If lie have
been dissatisfied with the existence of things at home, he may
perhaps not be averse to this, but let me
inform him. that he
will not find the
honsted
prairies of America
like
the mea-
dows of Knglaiid, the richest of the soil.
The advantages of
the most fertile regions of the States, are more than counter-
balanced
by
the
greater
insalubrity
of
the
climate when
compared to that of Canada.
TIjo
English emigrant may
rest assured, that he will not
lorg feel himself satisfied, and comfortable, amidst American
manners and custems, hut
will
become disgusted with
the
2)ecvHar system
of liberty, and
equality
that prevails in
the
States, and will regret, when too late, the step be has taken.
The most respectable, and best informed of the Americans,
are
already
tired
of the
child
(Liberty)
which they
have
reared
; and although, from expediency, they
still continue to
nurse
their
bantling,
are
well
convinced
that
a system
of
liberty and
ecjuality, so contrary
to all
experience, to every
law human and divine, cannot long exist.

grants
of this
year.
AVith
respect to those of former ones,
wherever
I went,

ing them.
If, in any instance, there were an exception to this,
it was uniformly accompanied by the expression, that he, or
they " might do M'ell, if they ivould."
Here
are millions of acres, of very
fine land, heavily tim-
bered,
still
uncleared.
Many
gentlemen
of
considerable
property,
have, within
these two
years,
settled
in Canada,
and much capital
is now endiarked in these provinces.
(lentlemen, although possessing capital, caimot themselves
clear the immense forests v.hich cover this fine country. Capi-
tal nmst come to the aid of the workman, by increasing the de-
nuvnd for his labour, and keeping up the present high rate of
wages
;
of which
1
will mention only two instances,
out of
many that came to my knowledge
;
\\n\.
8(inil)b
from
the
Isle of Wight, and Henry Ileasmau
from West
Grinstead,
were engaged at Blandford, the one at jt*25, and the other at
.£20. per anninu, with board and lodging.
The expence of living, taking every thing into consideration,
will not exceed one
half of what
it costs in England: every
thing
is cheap, for the poor man, except house rent ; but he is
usually lodged nnd fed, by his employer.
Articles of dress were foruKn-ly
dear,
but the competition,
caused
by a
greatly
ihcreased
demand,
has
already much
lowered their price, and
is continuing to do
so.
It
is cle; r
therefore,
that
this
is
the country for
the
mechanic, and
laborer.
Let the emigrant but carry with him frugal and industrious
habits, or the determination to
acipiire them, and he will be
sure to prosper.
But
it should be remarked, that the rate of wages, I have
mentioned, so advantageous to the poor
labourer, in the first

He will then,
in his turn feci the pressure of
high wages
: the price of oxen
also,
which
are indispensable,
is gradually
rising
with
the
increase of population, and of capital in the country.
The uum of small means, even
if he has been accustomed
to labour, finds considerable dilViculties
to
contciul with,
for
the first few years, in clearing the forest, and getting his land
into a state to produce a return.
'i'o him who has been brought up as a gentlenuin, the task
is still more severe, and very few of this class, are
(pialified to
succeed in
it.
No one therefore, vuidcr such
circumstances,
should make the attempt, unless
he
is
capable
of eiuhu'ing
fatigue and privation; can be
satisfied with the nccessari«'s of
life
; and look on
its luxuries with indilTerence.
Those who are possessed of such
<|ualifications, ami at the
same time, have a knowledge of agricultural pursuits,
a few
years will place in a state of comfortable independence.
He who has the command of money, may readily surmount
all the obiitades in his way, arising from theexpence of clear-
ing land
;

;
aiul the
expenco of living imtil he shall have cleared a sullicient (puni-
tity of land to meet his expenditure.
Much caution
is rccpiisite in making
a purchase,
not
only
to the man whose means are limited, but even to him who has
a
considerable conunand
of money.
In
purchasing from
(jovernment,
or
the Canada Company, great
care must bo
taken
to
ascertain,
the
<pialities
of the
soil;
the access to
roads
;
the facilities of water comnumication
; the existence
(»f good mill-streams
;
or,
as the Americans
call them water
privileges.
In
purchiising
of private
persons,
care nuist be taker, to
ascertain,
that
the
])roperty
is
perfectly unincumbered, by
tlebt, for which the land in Canada is at
all times answerable.
Into whatever township or district, the emigrant passes, he
will find many persons, who will represent
to him, that
the
land
in
their
particular neighbourhodd,
is
the
best
in
the
country
; who
will

;
or
hintini^',
that
hitherto,
no
system
of agriculture ha.s been adi)[)ted
in the
country, by whicli the land can he kept in proper heart.
I have observed land
in
Canada,
that had
been
cropped,
until, apparently,
it could be cropped no longer
; covered with
weeds
; and totally ne^^lected.
I believe
it to be an every
(l;iy occurrence in the Canadas,
as
well
as
in
the
United
States, for perilous
to
dispose of
lands,
in
this condition, and remove
further
into
the
bush,
(or woods,) where they can purchase at a lower price.
I am apprehensive that from the price of Government land
in Canada, four dollars per acre, many emigrants may be
in-
duced to go into the
States, where they can purchase at one
dollar and a (piarter, per acre, who would not otherwise think
of doing so.
Many respectable settlers disapprove of Government giving
Bmall grants of
land to industrious labourers, and persons of
small means
; for no better reason, than, that the dillicidty of
obtaining good and
respectid)le
servants,
which
is
already
very great,
is thereby increased.
The immense tracts of land
in the Canadas, in the posses-
sion of (i()\'ermnent, arc of no real
intrinsic value, so long as
they remain
in a state of nature
;
the first
object, therefore,
would seem
to be, io people the country
;
in order to convert
the
wild, and
i"')W
uncultivated
forest,
into
a
fruitful
soil,
increasing the revenue
of the
colonies
themselves,
and
the
commerce of the niother country, by a continually increasing
demand
for
her
manufactures,
providing the n\eans
of
still
further exertion, and thereby tending,
in no small degree, to
promote the stability and welfare of the British empire.
I do
not advocate
indiscriminate or unlimited emigration,
aware of the
evils and nrisery, that would
arise from such a
measure
:
but
if
it
bear a fair proportion
to the
increase of
cai)ital, carried out, and
if it be nuule, after previous arrange-
ments, well and duly considered,
the country cannot
be too
soon
covered, from
one end to the other, by the frugal and
industri(ms.
It is certainly, moat desirable, to secure the labours of the
actual cultivators of the soil
(for the labourer is the producer
of capital) by
allowing to many, or to all^ a small portion of
i;
i!
:?

nW^TCHRMHI

land, from ton to
thirty or
forty
acres,
at
a very moderate
price, thus givinjr them an
interest in the soil, and attucliing
them to their countiy.
It is not less desirable, to provide some clieck to the num-
ber
of speculators who
purchase
land,
witli
the
view
of
making a
profit,
by the advance in price; but actually
clear
no more than they are compelled to do, by the conditions of
sale.
One circumstance
surprised me
:
namely,
the
little en-
couragement
given
to
officers
of
the army and
navy,
to
become settleid.
Instead of a grant of land as formerly, the subaltern officer
is allowed tlie sum of i;l(W. equal to £1 15. currency.
And a
captain £'20(). equal
to
i;2;i0. currency.
According to the
present price
of land,
(4 dollars
per
acre,)
these
ofliccrs,
Avould
respectively,
obtain,
the
one
115
acres,
the
other
230 acres.
A private soldier still receives a grant of 100 acres. A Ser-
jeant of t!ie;i()tli. regt. of the luuno of Green,who went out with
me. was entitled to a grant of "200 acres. Steps were taken before
I left Canada, to obtain this for him
: and I doubt not, he has
actually received it.* Whence this disparity
?
probably at the
time when (!ertain
fixed sums of money to officers, instead of
land, wus dcterniined on, it was meant as a favour,
to enable
them to purdiase in
tl\e part of the country most agreeable to
themselves.
If the sudden, and great rise in the price of laiul
(which government, possibly, did not contemplate at the time)
has caused an arrangement, intended as beneficial, to become
so very injurious to a class of men who have such strong claims
on their country's gratitude, the remedy will be easy.
There are no men more? accustomed to hardship and fatigue}
none are better suited to become useful
settlers, than officers
of the navy and army.
No men
better calculated to preserve
regularity and order
; none whom it is so much the interest of
the country to encourage.
By making grants
to gentlemen of this
description,
such
as their rank and services may
fairly
warrant,
tliis
country
would secure to herself the attachment of a
host of men of
approved
loyalty, whose services an<l those
of their descen-
dants, wonld prove of inestimable value in the hour of need.
There are some persons belonging to our own country who
forbode that the Canadas will one day become
the con(jucst
Sec extract from his letter.

t)f Amrflca.
Our Government however, has wisely, although
at great expence, raised a powerful
barrier against
the
ac-
complishment of
this, by the formation of the Rideau canal
;
which at once opens a ready conveyance for troops, and
tlie
munitions of war
; and affords great advantages to the exten-
sive tracts of land on its
banks,
in the easy transit of their
produce
to market
; and at the same time,
a perfectly
safe
passage to those now emigrating, to the upper province, who
having obtained an interest
in the soil will,
I trust, not only
become
useful members of society, and truly independent in
tlieir
respective
spheres, but the
strenuous defenders
;
the
chief bulwark, of that portion of the British empire to which
so easy an access is thus afforded.
Being of opinion, that the committee had been
aggrieved
in the charge made on them by the steam boat that towed
us
to Montreal,
I
(before

If a plan similar to that adopted by the Petworth Committee,
were
followed, by
all concerned
in
sending
out emigrants,
we
should
neither hear of one half of the suffering, sickness,
or loss of human
life, which but too frequently occurs, espe-
cially to those from Ireland, not oidy during the
voyage, but
after their arrival
;
nor should we hear such tales, of the des-
titution and misery, in which many are left,
in the
streets of
Quebec or Montreal.
The complaints on
this subject, in the Canadian
Papers,
are loud, and numerous.
A few instances will suffice.
The brig Cottingham, of the same size as the
British Tar,
and which was at Grosse Isle with us, brought over from
Ireland 270 passengers, jvst double our number.
One
man belonging to this
vessel, was drowned on the 28th.
May, in coming on board from inspection, at Grosse Isle.
Capt. Robert Lawrie who commanded the
ship Thomas
Gclstone, from Londonderry to Quebec, admits that she
had a row of berths down the centre
;
carried out 317
souls, or 292/1(11 pussatjes
:
50, he says, nnder the num-
ber alloiced by law:
he states that he landed them
safe
at Grosse Isle, and in good health too
:
but that
sick-
ness had broken out among them since, owing
to
the
treatment which they received there.

Much
is
required
to
alleviate
the
discomforts
to which
landsmen, and more especially females and children, are sub-
ject at sea, to sooth the mind of tlie poor emigrant ;
to soften
the rigour of quarantine laws, and regulations
;
to check the
cupidity of some, and the knavery of others.
But there seems
little reason to hope, that
these matters
will be generally attended to, unless considerable
alterations
are made in the passengers' Act; as
it permits a ship to carry
a much greater number, than is consistent with the preservation
of health.
The remedy
is simple, and may easily be etfected
in the following manner.
Every ship or vessel, under 250 tons, to
allow
twelve feet
superficial,
for the
sleeping berth of every passenger or full
passage
(i. e. one person above, or two under 14 years of age)
Under 350 tons ten feet.
And in all ships or vessels, above
350 tons nine
feet.
The space to be allowed in each ship or vessel, will thus be
determined hy her
tonnage.
And
the number of passengers,
by the quantity oi clear space set apart, for their use.
The centre space, in every vessel
carrying passengers, to
be entirely free of berths.
And in no division or apartment
of any such vessel, to
be permitted a greater number of pas-
sengers, than in proportion to the ypace required in each sliip,
uccording to its class.
This will allow owe
passenger to every two tons
;
but
as
regulating
the number by tonnage, is more
liable to abuse,
than by space,
I prefer the latter mode.
The Americans require a stiil greater space to be allowed,
than I have recommended
; and their regulations, with regar(l
to ships carrying passengers, are in otlicr respects, very strict,
as will appear by the foUowing extract.

one
hundred and
fifty dollars, for every passenger above the
number allowed.
Sect. 2nd.
That,
if the passengers on board any ship or
vessel, shall exceed the number allowed, by twenty pas-
sengers in the whole, every such ship or vessel,
shall
be
forfeited to the United
States.
Sect. 3rd.
That every ship or vessel,
shall have on board
at the time of
sailing, properly secured under deck,
at
least sixty gallons of water, one hundred pounds of salted
provisions, one gallon of vinegar, and one hundred pounds
of wholesome ship bread, for every

any passenger
is put on short allowance, in water, flesh,
vinegar, or

the

In concluding these remarks, I beg again to impress on the
reader, my decided preference of Upper Canada, to the United
States, as a place of settlement
for
British Emigrants j
and
to assure them, that they may arrive at Toronto, or any place
westward of that city, by Montreal, and the liideau canal, at
much less expence and risk, than by New York
; and I need
hardly add, that it is evidently the interest, of every emigrant,
to spend his money, small as the sum may be,
individually,
in
the provinces helonjrinj;^ to
his native
country, and now
the land of his adoption.
On his arrival at Toronto, he will
meet with every
possible attention from Sir John
Colborne,
and the best advice from A. B. Hawke, Esq.,
the emigrant
agent of that place, where to direct his steps for employment'

If he be the father of a numerous family, he may probably,
even receive some facility, in reaching the spot recommended.
And should he have sons and daughters grown
up,
or even
above ten years of age, they will be of infinite service to him.
I may say, with the Psalmist, "happy

his quiver full of them."

man, after putting the question, who
shall come to Canada ?
facetiously, and
significantly, answers, in the motto he has
adopted for his chapter, "come a* thegither" I do not say go

Extract from « The Advocate," jmblished at
(a) Toronto,
Upper Canada.
Township of (A) Nichol,
.
February VMli. 1834.
*' Mr.
Fergussoii having purchased a portion of the ahove
Township, fronting upon
the Grand River, and commencing
about 2
miles, above the Falls of
Ellora, takes this method
of acquainting
intending
settlers of
respectable
character,
that he is prepared to receive proposals, and will have a plan
to exhibit, as soon as the weather will admit of the surveyor
perambulating the ground.
It
is Mr.
Fergusson's intention, without delay, to erect a
good Saw and
Grist
Mill, a Bridge upon the River, and a
Tavern for the accommodation of travellers, and to use every
exertion, towards improving the communication with Dundas
Street, in the shortest and most convenient line.
A Church and
School
House,
will
also be
built by Mr.
Fergusson, so soon as a proper Clergyman, and teacher can
be provided.
From the situation being healthy, and dry, with a fine run
of the purest water, a small
Village may
be
advanUigeously
established,
and Mr.
Fergusson
is
desirous
to
treat with
respectable Mechanics
for
Building Lots, and to whom he
will afford every encouragement and facility in his power.
N. B.—For
further
particulars, application may be made
to Mr. Webster,
at the Little
Falls,
Nichol ;
or to
Adam
Fergusson,
Esq.
Drunnnondville,
Niagara
Falls.
