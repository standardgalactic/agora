Important: With Stars! being a very old commercial game, you will need to find and use serial codes to be able to use the full functionality of the game. Included in the stars26i.rar archive you will find a text file named code.txt listing 16 serial codes compatible with this version of Stars!. You will then be able to, using those serial numbers, host and play games with your friends.

Please note that version 26i is not the latest version of Stars!. The latest version is 26JRC4 or 27JRC4. While it is possible for you to download the available patches to upgrade to the latest version, please note again that the serial codes provided in the text file are codes which were leaked on the internet and thus blacklisted in the J patch and up. Those codes are provided to you solely to be used with the matching stars26i.rar archive.

It is possible for you to visit http://starsautohost.org/sahforum and ask that a new serial number be generated for you, for a minimal donation fee.

If you wish to join the AutoHost site and take part in the games hosted with their automated host then you will require a valid and unique JRC4 serial number.

Because Stars! was designed to run on Windows 3.1 and Windows 95, you may experience problems running version 2.7 on later Windows versions. In particular, version 2.7 requires wavemix.dll, which is no longer supplied with Windows. To install it, simply copy it into your [c:\windows] directory (or wherever you installed Windows.)

You will find wavemix.rar supplied in this archive.

For those who will want to play and host a game without having access to the internet and the Wiki, you will find a text file named "How_to_Host_a_Game_v2.0_by_Omonubi.txt" in the archive. While it is an old version, most/all of the relevant parts for hosting games are still accurate today.
